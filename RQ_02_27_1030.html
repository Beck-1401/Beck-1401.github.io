            <h3 id="intro" class="transcript-section">Introduction and Podcast Instructions</h3>
            <p><strong>Brad:</strong> Better. Let's see. But yeah. So, we'll stop at what's 11:15? Right? You finish at 11:45? So we'll stop at 11:15, maybe a few minutes before then. Just make sure that you have, you know, full half hour for finding a place and recording a podcast. Any questions about the podcast? You do not have to record it at that time, right? If y'all, if you have reasons or if somebody's absent or you want to if you have something else planned, that's fine. All I really just need it before the Tuesday after the break. So, you got plenty of time. But, go ahead and knock it out today if you're ready. The pretty clear about everything that should be covered in that? Went over that the other day, right? Okay, cool.</p>
            <p><strong>Brad:</strong> By the way, I do have these. I'm not going to give them to you right now, because there's some questions that come from this. But I do have some more of these. I didn't find them the other day. But if you missed the handout from last Thursday, I have them.</p>

            <h3 id="quiz-setup" class="transcript-section">Quiz Game Setup and Rules</h3>
            <p><strong>Brad:</strong> Let's so what I'd like you to do is get with your teams just so I can kind of visually see everybody kind of clump together. So as long as you're just kind of like clumped a little bit, then that's cool. And we'll do team-based team-based. I didn't come up with a prize. I suggested the winning team can choose a TikTok dance for me to do. That would require starting stopping a little bit earlier. Anybody want Play-Doh while we're playing?</p>
            <p><strong>Student 1:</strong> Yeah.</p>
            <p><strong>Brad:</strong> I'll just... (distributes Play-Doh) These questions... These you do not have to form You do not have to form your answer in the form of a question. Just, just give your answer.</p>
            <p><strong>Student 2:</strong> I don't know, do I have to get the words direct entirely correct?</p>
            <p><strong>Brad:</strong> You have to get the words correct. Yes.</p>
            <p><strong>Student 2:</strong> Because I forgot Poetics last time and I got told the guilty rocks.</p>
            <p><strong>Brad:</strong> I had a I had a student a couple of years ago said after their exam that they didn't do very well on. They were like yeah, I know that I got the words wrong, but I got the gist of what I was saying. It's like, yeah, try that in math class. I know I got the numbers wrong, but I got the I got the gist. So yes, you have to get the words right. Huh?</p>
            <p><strong>Student 3:</strong> But those are like the best math teachers.</p>
            <p><strong>Brad:</strong> I'm not a math teacher, so yeah. But like In my math class, you'd have to get the numbers right, I guess. So, so yeah, you got to get the words right. There are definitely some of these questions that we have not really tackled yet. Some of them, some of them are intended to be educational, but we will see these questions again. So, so yeah, this won't be the, this will not be the only time that we play. Another thing is, they are not in any particular order. So, they're all of them are just worth one point. Everything's worth one point. So, when it's your turn, we could have dice roll. Should we have dice roll? Cuz it's so stressful like picking who was the first to raise their hand. Yeah, let's do or let's or we could just go in order and then dice roll. How about that? So, we'll go in team order. So we'll start we'll start with team one. We'll go from one to eight, and then we'll go from eight to one. And if your team doesn't get the question right. So your team will pick a question. And then if you don't get it right, we'll go to a dice roll and then and then regardless of who gets the answer right, we'll go to the next team on the list. Does that make sense? So, cool. Okay, so then Patrick, Quincy, Amber, and Sailor. So you've got any of these categories: Descending into Vaishnavism, Greek to Me, Sacred Text Sanskrit Edition, Sanskrit Smorgasbord.</p>
            <p><strong>Student 4:</strong> Do they like scale in difficulty though?</p>
