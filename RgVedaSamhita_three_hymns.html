                 <p class="intro-text">we know that we do not know, which would then be mere pretending, but that we really do not know even if it is at all knowable by any possible knowledge. The hymn concludes with this query, this constitutive uncertainty which is of infinite magnitude, because we are all involved in it. To answer the query would amount to killing the very unfolding of reality. It is the openness of this interrogation which allows the universe to emerge and to exist.</p>

                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">1.</span>In the beginning the Golden Embryo arose. Once he was born, he was the one lord of creation. He held in place the earth and this sky. Who is the god whom we should worship with the oblation?</p>
                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.</span>He who gives life, who gives strength, whose command all the gods, his own, obey; his shadow is immortality and death. Who is the god whom we should worship with the oblation?</p>

                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.</span>He by whom the awesome sky and the earth were made firm, by whom the dome of the sky was propped up, and the sun, who measured out the middle realm of space who is the god whom we should worship with the oblation?</p>
                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.</span>He to whom the two opposed masses looked with trembling in their hearts, supported by his help, on whom the rising sun shines down – who is the god whom we should worship with the oblation?</p>
                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7.</span>When the high waters came, pregnant with the embryo that is everything, bringing forth fire, he arose from that as the one life's breath of the gods. Who is the god whom we should worship with the oblation?</p>
                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.</span>He who in his greatness looked over the waters, which were pregnant with Dakṣa, bringing forth the sacrifice, he who was the one god among all the gods – who is the god whom we should worship with the oblation?</p>
                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.</span>Let him not harm us, he who fathered the earth and created the sky, whose laws are true, who created the high, shining waters. Who is the god whom we should worship with the oblation?</p>
                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10.</span>O Prajāpati, lord of progeny, no one but you embraces all these creatures. Grant us the desires for which we offer you oblation. Let us be lords of riches.</p>

                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.</span>It is the Person who is all this, whatever has been and whatever is to be. It is the ruler of immortality, growing beyond everything through food.</p>
                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.</span>Such is the Person's greatness, and the Person is yet more than this. All creatures are a quarter of it; three quarters are what is immortal in heaven.</p>
                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">4.</span>With three quarters the Person rose upwards, and one quarter still remains here. From this, it spread out in all directions, into that which eats and that which does not eat.</p>
                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">5.</span>Viraj [the "golden embryo”] was born from this Person, and from Viraj came the Person. When it was born, it ranged beyond the earth behind and before.</p>
                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">6.</span>When the gods spread the sacrifice with the Person as the offering, spring was the clarified butter, summer the fuel, autumn the oblation.</p>
                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">7.</span>They anointed the Person, the sacrifice born at the beginning, upon the sacred grass. With the Person, the gods, Sadhyas, and sages sacrificed.</p>
                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.</span>From that sacrifice in which everything was offered, the melted fat was collected, and the Person made it into those beasts who live in the air, in the forest, and in villages.</p>
                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">9.</span>From that sacrifice in which everything was offered, the verses and chants were born, the meters were born from it, and from it the mantras were born.</p>
                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">10.</span>Horses were born from it, and those other animals that have two rows of teeth; cows were born from it, and from it goats and sheep were born.</p>
                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">11.</span>When they divided the Person, into how many parts did they apportion it? What do they call its mouth, its two arms and thighs and feet?</p>
                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">12.</span>Its mouth became the Brahmin [priests/scholars]; its arms were made into the Warriors, its thighs the Merchants/craftsmen, and from its feet the Servants were born.</p>
                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">13.</span>The moon was born from its mind; from its eye the sun was born. Indra [God] and Agni [Fire] came from its mouth, and from its vital breath the Wind was born.</p>
                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">14.</span>From its navel the middle realm of space arose; from its head the sky evolved. From its two feet came the earth, and the quarters of the sky from its ear. Thus, they set the worlds in order.</p>
                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">15.</span>There were seven enclosing-sticks for it, and thrice seven fuel-sticks, when the gods, spreading the sacrifice, bound the Person as the sacrificial beast.</p>
                    <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">16.</span>With the sacrifice, the gods sacrificed to the sacrifice. These were the first ritual laws [Dharmas]. These very powers reached the dome of the sky where dwell the Sadhyas, the ancient gods.</p>
