                <h2>Chapter 2: The Slaughter of Mahiṣāsura’s Armies</h2>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.1</span><span class="speaker-note">The seer said:</span></p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.2</span>“Long ago, when Mahiṣa was chief of the asuras and Indra was chief of the gods, there was a war between their forces for a full hundred years.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.3</span>The valorous asuras vanquished the army of the gods, and after all were conquered, Mahiṣa became the lord of heaven.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.4</span>Then led by Brahmā, the lord of beings, the defeated gods went to Viṣṇu and Śiva</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.5</span>and related in detail what had happened. The thirty gods told how Mahiṣāsura had wrought their defeat:</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.6</span>‘He has usurped the authority of Sūrya, Indra, Agni, Vāyu, and Candra, and of Yama, Varuṇa, and all the others.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.7</span>Cast out from heaven by the evil Mahiṣa, all the multitudes of gods wander over the earth as mere mortals.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.8</span>We have related all that this foe of the gods has done, and we seek refuge in You. Be pleased to devise a means for his destruction.’</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.9</span>When Viṣṇu and Śiva heard the entreaties of the gods, they knit their brows in fury and contorted their faces,</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.10</span>whereupon a great radiance came forth from Viṣṇu’s rage- filled countenance, and so, too, from Brahmā’s and Śiva’s.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.11</span>And from Indra’s body and from the bodies of all the other gods, a very great light issued, and it united and became one.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.12</span>The gods saw before them a peak of light like a mountain, blazing brightly and pervading the sky in every direction with its flames.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.13</span>Unequaled light, born from the bodies of all the gods, coalesced into a female form and pervaded the three worlds with its splendor.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.14</span>From Śiva’s light came that which formed the Devī’s face. Yama’s radiance formed Her hair, and Viṣṇu’s effulgence became Her arms.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.15</span>The moon god’s soft light formed Her breasts, and Indra’s brilliance became Her waist. Varuṇa’s light became Her legs, and earth’s splendor formed Her hips.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.16</span>Her feet took shape from Brahmā’s light and Her toes from Sūrya’s brilliance. From the Vasus’ light Her fingers formed and from Kubera’s light, Her nose.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.17</span>From Prajāpati’s lustre came Her teeth, and from Agni’s radiance Her three eyes were born.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.18</span>Dawn and dusk became Her eyebrows, the wind god’s splendor shaped Her ears, and all else born of the other gods’ light shone too as the auspicious Devī.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.19</span>Then, beholding Her who appeared from out of their amassed light, all those gods, tormented by Mahiṣa, rejoiced.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.20</span>Then the gods bestowed on Her their own weapons and adornments. From his trident Śiva drew forth another and gave it to Her,</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.21</span>and Viṣṇu bestowed a discus spun out from his own. Varuṇa gave Her a conch; and Agni, the eater of oblations, gave Her a spear.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.22</span>Vāyu, the wind god, presented a bow and two quivers filled with arrows. Extracting a thunderbolt from his own, Indra, the lord of the immortals,</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.23</span>the all-seeing one, gave it to Her along with a bell from his elephant Airāvata. From his staff of death Yama produced another staff, and Varuṇa, the lord of waters, gave a noose.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.24</span>Brahmā, the lord of beings, gave prayer beads and an ascetic’s waterpot. Sūrya, the bringer of day, bestowed his rays of sunlight on all the pores of Her skin;</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.25</span>and Kāla, the lord of time, presented a sword and shining shield. The ocean of milk bestowed a necklace of flawless pearls, ever-new garments,</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.26</span>a celestial crest-jewel, earrings, and bracelets, a radiant crescent-shaped ornament, armlets for all Her arms,</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.27</span>a pair of shining anklets, a necklace beyond compare, and bejeweled rings for all Her fingers.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.28</span>Viśvakarman gave Her a gleaming ax, weapons of all kinds, and impenetrable armor.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.29</span>Garlands of unfading lotuses for Her head and breast the ocean gave to Her, and yet another magnificent lotus to grace Her hand.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.30</span>Himālaya, the lord of mountains, gave Her a lion to ride upon and jewels of many kinds; and Kubera, the lord of wealth, presented a drinking vessel ever-brimming with wine.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.31</span>Śeṣa, the lord of serpents, who supports this earth, gave Her a garland of snakes, adorned with precious gems.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.32</span>Honored also by the other gods with adornments and weapons, the Devī laughed thunderously and defiantly again and again.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.33</span>She filled the entire sky with Her terrible roar, and from the immeasurable din a great echo resounded.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.34</span>All the worlds shook, and the oceans churned. The earth quaked, and the mountains heaved.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.35</span>In joy the gods exclaimed, ‘Victory!’ to the lion-mounted Devī; and with bodies bowed in devotion, the sages praised Her.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.36</span>When the enemies of the gods saw the three worlds in upheaval, they readied all their forces for battle and rose up as one, with weapons held high.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.37</span>‘Aha! What is this?’ Mahiṣāsura bellowed in wrath. Surrounded by countless asuras, he rushed toward the sound</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.38</span>and then beheld the Devī, who pervaded the three worlds with Her radiance, bending the earth under Her tread, scraping the sky with Her diadem,</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.39</span>shaking all the nether regions with the resonance of Her bowstring, and standing there, penetrating every direction with Her thousand arms.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.40</span>Thereupon, the battle began between the Devī and the enemies of the gods. Swords and missiles, hurled in every direction, lit up the quarters of the sky.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.41</span>Mahiṣāsura’s general, the great asura named Cikṣura, battled there, and Cāmara led cavalry, charioteers, elephant-drivers, and foot soldiers.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.42</span>The great asura called Udagra commanded sixty thousand chariots, Mahāhanu gave battle with his ten million,</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.43</span>and the mighty Asiloman fought with forces fifty million strong. With sixty million Bāṣkala fought in the conflict.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.44</span>Encircled by streaming multitudes of elephants and horses, Parivārita fought in that battle with ten million chariots,</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.45</span>and he who is called Biḍāla, with five billion chariots surrounding him, engaged in combat there.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.46</span>Amid chariots, elephants, and horses, myriads of other great asuras battled with the Devī,</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.47</span>their countless chariots, elephants, and horses surrounding Māhiṣāsura there in the fray.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.48</span>With lances and javelins, spears and clubs, swords and axes, and sharp-edged spears, they fought with the Devī.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.49</span>Some hurled spears while others threw nooses; intent on killing Her, they began an assault with their swords.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.50</span>But She, the Devī Caṇḍikā, showered down all manner of weapons and cut through their armaments as if in play.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.51</span>Praised by gods and seers, She remained serene, even while unleashing Her weapons at the asuras’ bodies.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.52</span>Her lion-mount, shaking its mane in fury, stalked among the demon throngs as fire rages through a Forest.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.53</span>The sighs that Ambikā heaved while fighting became at once Her legions by the hundreds and thousands.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.54</span>They fought with axes, javelins, swords, and sharp- edged spears, and drawing strength from Her power, they destroyed the demon hordes.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.55</span>Some of Her throngs beat war drums resoundingly, some blew conches, and others drummed upon tabors in their zest for battle.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.56</span>Then the Devī, with Her trident, club, and volleys of spears, with Her swords and other weapons, slew great asuras by the hundreds</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.57</span>and brought down still more with the confounding din of Her bell. Binding other asuras with Her noose, She dragged them along the ground.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.58</span>Her swordstrokes slashed others in two, while crushing blows from Her mace brought still more down,</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.59</span>and those bludgeoned by Her club vomited forth blood. Others fell to the ground, pierced through the chest by Her trident.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.60</span>Her steady stream of arrows made some on that battlefield resemble bristling porcupines, and those tormenters of the gods breathed their last.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.61</span>Some had their arms severed, others their necks broken. The heads of others rolled, and still others had their bodies ripped apart.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.62</span>Great asuras, their legs cut from under them, toppled to the ground. Some, severed lengthwise by the Devī, were left one-armed, one-eyed, one-legged.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.63</span>While others there in the battle danced to the throbbing drums, those that She decapitated fell and rose again,</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.64</span>headless bodies, still grasping swords, spears, and lances in hand. ‘Stop! Stop!’ other great asuras cried out to the Devī.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.65</span>Where that great battle raged, the earth was impassable with fallen chariots, elephants, horses, and corpses.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.66</span>Torrents of blood, like mighty rivers, gushed from elephants, asuras, and horses there in the midst of the demon army.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.67</span>In an instant, Ambikā led that vast legion of foes to its destruction, as quickly as fire consumes a heap of straw and wood.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.68</span>And Her lion, roaring thunderously and shaking its mane, prowled about in search of life- breath still issuing from the enemies’ bodies.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">2.69</span>So did the Devī’s hosts wage war against the asuras. So also did the gods in heaven shower down flowers in praise.”</p>

                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.5</span>Like lightning, She slashed through his bow and highflying banner. Having destroyed his bow, She wounded him in the limbs with Her swift arrows.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.6</span>With bow broken, chariot wrecked, and horses and charioteer slain, the asura, armed with sword and shield, rushed at the Devī.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.7</span>First striking Her lion on the head with his sharp-edged sword, he violently struck the Devī’s left arm.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.8</span>O king, as soon as the sword touched Her, it shattered. Then, the great asura, his eyes red with rage, seized his blazing lance</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.9</span>and flung it at Bhadrakālī, as though he were hurling the very sun from the sky.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.10</span>Seeing it approach, the Devī released Her lance and shattered the great asura and his weapon into a hundred pieces.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.11</span>When Mahiṣa’s mighty general lay slain, Cāmara, the afflictor of the gods, advanced, mounted on an elephant.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.12</span>He dispatched his spear toward the Devī. Quickly Ambikā’s contemptuous outcry sent it hurtling powerless to the ground.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.13</span>Seeing it fallen and shattered, the enraged Cāmara flung a lance, and that, too, She destroyed with Her arrows.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.14</span>Her lion then leapt up and, astride the elephant’s forehead, engaged fiercely in direct combat with the enemy of the gods.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.15</span>Struggling, the two fell from the elephant to the ground, still locked in dreadful combat.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.16</span>In a flash the lion sprang skyward, then alighted and severed Cāmara’s head with a single blow of its paw.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.17</span>In the fighting the Devī assailed the asura Udagra with rocks and trees; and biting, punching, and slapping Karāla, She felled him, too.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.18</span>Enraged, the Devī crushed Uddhata to a pulp with the blows of Her mace. She killed Bāṣkala with Her javelin and Tāmra and Andhaka with Her arrows,</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.19</span>and with Her trident the supreme three-eyed Goddess slew Ugrāsya, Ugravīrya, and also Mahāhanu.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.20</span>With Her sword She struck Biḍāla’s head from his body, and with Her arrows She dispatched both Durdhara and Durmukha to the abode of death.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.21</span>While his army thus met destruction, Mahiṣāsura terrified the Devī’s hosts with his own buffalo form,</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.22</span>jostling some with his snout and pawing others with his hooves. Others he lashed with his tail and lacerated with his horns.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.23</span>He toppled some of them to the ground with the unleashed force of his bellowing and wheeling about, and the blast of his breath brought still others down.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.24</span>After destroying the great Goddess’s forces, Mahiṣāsura rushed forward to slay Her lion. At that, Ambikā became enraged.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.25</span>But Mahiṣāsura, great in valor, struck the earth angrily with his hooves, flung mountains skyward with his horns, and bellowed frightfully.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.26</span>Under his frenzied wheeling, the trampled earth broke apart. Lashed by his tail, the ocean overflowed all around.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.27</span>Thrashed by his horns, the clouds fragmented and dispersed. Tossed about on his blasting breath, mountains by the hundreds fell from the sky.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.28</span>When She saw the great asura approaching, inflated with rage, Caṇḍikā aroused Her wrath and prepared to slay him.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.29</span>She threw Her noose over him and bound him. Fettered thus in the fierce battle, the great asura left his buffalo form</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.30</span>and assumed the shape of a lion. No sooner had Ambikā severed his head than he appeared as a man with sword in hand.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.31</span>Instantly, with Her arrows the Devī cut him to shreds along with his sword and shield. Then he took the form of a great elephant</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.32</span>and dragged Her mighty lion along with his trunk, but while he trumpeted loudly, the Devī chopped off his trunk with Her sword.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.33</span>Once more the great asura assumed his buffalo form and caused the three worlds, with all that is moving and unmoving, to tremble.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.34</span>Angered, Caṇḍikā, the Mother of the worlds, drank a divine potion, and with eyes reddened She laughed again and again.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.35</span>The asura bellowed in return, intoxicated with his own might and valor, and with his horns he hurled mountains at Caṇḍikā.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.36</span>Her volley of arrows reduced them to dust. Her face flushed with inebriation from the divine drink, and She addressed him excitedly.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.37</span><span class="speaker-note">The Devī said:</span></p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.38</span>‘Bellow, you fool, bellow for now while I drink this potion. After I have slain you, the gods will cheer in this very place.”’</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.39</span><span class="speaker-note">The seer said:</span></p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.40</span>“Having declared that, She leapt upon the great asura, pinned his neck down with Her foot, and pierced him through with Her spear.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.41</span>Trapped there under the Devī’s foot and crushed by Her might, he emerged half-way in his true form from his buffalo mouth.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.42</span>Half-revealed and fighting still, that great asura fell to the Devī, beheaded by Her great sword.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.43</span>Then crying out in alarm, the whole demon army perished, and all the divine hosts exulted.</p>
                <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">3.44</span>Together with the great heavenly seers the gods praised the Devī, the celestial musicians sang, and throngs of cloud-nymphs danced.</p>

                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.2</span>“After caṇḍa was killed, muṇḍa slain, and the vast armies annihilated, the lord of asuras</p>
                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.3</span>burned with rage. His reason overcome, śumbha ordered the marshaling of all the demon hosts:</p>
                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.4</span>‘Now let the daitya clans with all their troops go forth, the eighty-six udāyudha and the eighty-four kambu families, together with their forces.</p>

                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.7</span>Having issued his orders, śumbha, the despotic lord of asuras, went forth, attended by many thousands of mighty troops.</p>
                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.8</span>Seeing that most formidable army approach, Caṇḍikā Filled the space between earth and sky with the resonance of Her Bowstring</p>

                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.10</span>Kālī Drowned out the din of bowstring, lion, and bell, filling every direction With Terrifying Howls from Her Gaping Mouth.</p>
                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.11</span>Hearing the tumult, the enraged demon armies closed in on The Devī, Her lion, and Kālī from all four sides.</p>
                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.12</span>O king, at that very moment, to insure the well-being of the supreme Gods and to annihilate their adversaries, surpassingly brave and powerful</p>
                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.13</span>śaktis, the Gods’ embodied powers, sprang forth from the bodies of Brahmā, Śiva, Skanda, Viṣṇu, and Indra, mirroring the form of each. They approached Caṇḍikā.</p>
                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.14</span>Whatever that God’s form was, whatever his adornments and his mount, in that very form his śakti went forth to combat the asuras.</p>
                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.15</span>In a celestial chariot drawn by swans, Brahmā’s śakti came forth with prayer beads and waterpot in hand. She is called Brahmāṇī.</p>
                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.16</span>Māheśvarī arrived astride a bull, holding the finest trident, wearing great serpents for bracelets, and adorned with the crescent moon.</p>
                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.17</span>Ambikā, having the war God’s form and riding a fine peacock, came forth as Kaumārī with spear in hand to fight against the daityas.</p>
                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.18</span>Likewise the śakti Vaiṣṇavī, mounted on Garuda, approached holding conch, discus, mace, bow, and sword.</p>
                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.19</span>The śakti of Hari, Who Bears the Unique Form of The Sacrificial Boar, Came Forward As Vārāhī in that Boarlike Aspect.</p>
                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.20</span>Nārasiṁhī, resembling Viṣṇu’s embodiment as a man-lion, arrived there, scattering the constellations with the toss of Her Mane.</p>
                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.21</span>Thousand-eyed like Indra, and in like manner with thunderbolt in hand, Aindrī Arrived Riding on the lord of elephants.</p>
                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.22</span>Then Śiva, surrounded by those śaktis of the Gods, said to Caṇḍikā, ‘Let the asuras quickly be slain for My satisfaction.’</p>
                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.23</span>Thereupon from The Devī’s Body there issued Forth Caṇḍikā’s Own Terrifying śakti, savage in Her Fury and Howling like a hundred jackals.</p>
                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.24</span>And She, The Unvanquished One, said to Śiva of dark, matted locks, ‘Go, My Lord, as My Messenger to śumbha and niśumbha.</p>

                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.27</span>But if through the conceit of strength you are desirous of battle, then come and let My jackals be satiated with your flesh!”’</p>
                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.28</span>Since The Devī appointed Śiva himself as messenger, She Has Come to be Known in this world As Śivadūtī.</p>
                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.29</span>Hearing Śiva declare The Devī’s words, the great asuras were filled with indignation and went to where Kātyāyanī stood.</p>
                 <p class="verse"><span class="verse-number">8.30</span>At the outbreak of battle, the Gods’ adversaries, arrogant in their anger, rained torrents of arrows, spears, and lances upon The Devī.</p>
