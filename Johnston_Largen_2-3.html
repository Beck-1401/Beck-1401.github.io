                        <h4>1. What Is Hinduism?</h4>
                        <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>In order to present a clear description of who Krishna is and how he saves, it is necessary to give a brief overview of Hinduism, including a discussion of the god Vishnu. Only then will the reader be prepared to learn about Krishna.</p>
                        <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>Of the five major world religions (Hinduism, Judaism, Buddhism, Christianity, and Islam), it is certainly the case that Hinduism is both the least understood and the least experienced by most Americans. This state of ignorance will not continue, however, as the Hindu population both in the United States and worldwide continues to grow. The website for Diana Eck's well-regarded Pluralism Project (based at Harvard University) cites the following statistics regarding Hinduism: "The 1990 U.S. Census indicated that the number of Asian Indians in the United States (not all of them Hindus) increased 125 percent during the 1980s, rising to 815,000 (about 0.3 percent of the U.S. population). When non-Asian Hindus are incorporated into the equation, one arrives at a total of well over I million Hindus residing in the United States."<sup>1</sup> What's more, the Pluralism Project directory lists 723 Hindu temples and centers in the United States, and notes that there is a Hindu center and/or temple in every state, with the exception of Montana, Wyoming, North Dakota, South Dakota, and Vermont.<sup>2</sup> If Christians want to follow the two imperatives discussed in chapter I—not bearing false witness against one's neighbor, and loving one's neighbor—then it is incumbent upon Christians to learn something about Hinduism, particularly in light of the many misconceptions having to do with Hindu worship and the concept of the deity in Hinduism.</p>

                        <section id="ch2-sec1-1-1">
                             <h5>1. A Religion of Great Diversity</h5>
                             <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>The first thing that must be stated is that, in fact, Hinduism is not one religion. Instead, it is more accurately seen as a medley of religious traditions that originated in India, best described not as "a monolithic entity but rather a conglomerate of religions that share certain traits in common."<sup>3</sup> The word Hinduism itself is an artificial word, coined by scholars in the West in an effort to name and categorize Indian religion on the model of Christianity.<sup>4</sup></p>
                             <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>To offer an analogy from the Western context, imagine if someone from India had come to the Middle East around the tenth century and determined that Judaism, Christianity, and Islam were all variations of the same religion—let's call it "Arabism"—simply because they all were founded in the same general area, and they all had their roots in the same mythology, sharing similar stories and similar ideas about the world, God, and humanity. To some degree, this is what happened in India. While today we are left with a word that is almost impossible to do without, we must recognize that it does not carry nearly the specificity of meaning once assumed. In light of this, many scholars would agree with the statement that "Today without wanting to admit it, we know that Hinduism is nothing but an orchid cultivated by European scholarship. It is much too beautiful to be torn out, but it is a greenhouse plant: It does not exist in nature."<sup>5</sup></p>
                             <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>Hinduism has several unique features that set it apart from the other religions mentioned above and that contribute to Hinduism's diversity of belief and practice. First, while there is no shortage of historical scholars, sages, and teachers in Hinduism, there is no historical founder of the religion as a whole, no figure comparable to Jesus, the Buddha, Abraham, or Muhammad. Consequently, there is no firm date of origin for Hinduism. Scholars agree that Hinduism is the oldest living major religious tradition, but beyond that simple fact there is much debate, since it is clear that what we today call Hinduism is made up of different beliefs and practices that were handed down orally for millennia before they were finally written down. Thus, because the oral transmission of tradition is notoriously difficult to establish conclusively, there are wide variances even among scholars as to when certain texts, specific practices, and key doctrines originated. For example, the earliest known sacred texts of Hinduism, the Vedas, date back to at least 3000 BCE, but some scholars date them back even further, to 8000 to 6000 BCE, and some Hindus themselves believe these texts to be of divine origin and therefore timeless. Second, there is no clear established religious hierarchy that determines official Hindu doctrine or practice. Thus, there is no one who can speak for Hindus as a whole and no single authority regarding what is orthodox and heterodox. This is perhaps one reason why, unlike members of most other religious traditions, "most Hindus would not define their religion in terms of a single creed that embodies the faith because different Hindus believe in many different things."<sup>6</sup> This is not to say, however, that there are no general characteristics of Hinduism that can be articulated. For example, here is one list of principles that, by practitioner consensus, characterize one as "Hindu":</p>

                                 <li>Belief in the divinity of the Vedas</li>
                                 <li>Belief in one, all-pervasive Supreme Reality</li>

                                 <li>Belief in karma</li>
                                 <li>Belief in reincarnation</li>

                             </ol>
                             <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>Another example of a similar list comes from the Indian Supreme Court, which produced the following set of workable criteria as to what it means to be a Hindu:</p>
                             <ol>
                                 <li>The Vedas should be accepted and revered as the foundation of Hindu philosophy</li>
                                 <li>One should have a spirit of tolerance, and recognize that the truth has many sides</li>
                                 <li>One accepts belief in recurring cosmic cycles of creation, preservation and dissolution</li>
                                 <li>One accepts belief in reincarnation</li>
                                 <li>One recognizes that there are numerous paths to truth and salvation</li>
                                 <li>One recognizes that although the worship of idols may be deemed unnecessary, there may be many deities worthy of worship</li>
                                 <li>In distinction from followers of other religions, one does not believe in a specific set of theological or philosophical conceptions.<sup>8</sup></li>
                              </ol>
                             <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>Clearly, the breadth of these criteria goes far beyond what is found in Christianity. However, as should be evident from the emphasis on tolerating the different beliefs of others, respecting the pluriformity of truth, and recognizing the diversity of belief and practice, any talk of Hinduism as a whole needs to keep this multiplicity in mind. One scholar has suggested the following metaphor: "If the essence of Hinduism could be summarized in a few words, those words might be 'structured diversity.' We might think of Hinduism as a rainbow in which all the different colors are represented, but in which each of these colors has a very distinct place in the spectrum."<sup>9</sup></p>

                            <h5>2. Sacred Texts of Hinduism</h5>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>Another feature of Hinduism is the fact that there is no single, authoritative text in Hinduism that functions like the Bible for Christians or the Qur'an for Muslims. Instead, there are several different collections of texts that have authority.</p>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>First are the Vedas. The Vedas represent the most important category of sacred writings. In the narrowest sense "Veda" refers to the four Samhitas (collections) of sacred texts of ancient India. They are the oldest body of literature and are traditionally held to be eternal and of non-human origin. The most important of the Vedas and the most well-known in the West is the Rig Veda, which comprises a large collection of hymns praising various gods and goddesses and telling various stories of creation.<sup>10</sup> The Vedas are the collection of writings held to be the basis of true belief and practice among Hindus.</p>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>Second are the Upanishads, which do not share the Vedas' focus on ritual and sacrifice but instead describe a more philosophical and theoretical approach to the practice of Hinduism.<sup>11</sup> The primary teaching of the Upanishads is that the self (atman) is identical to the Ultimate ground of reality (Brahman), and the person who realizes this sacred truth (through disciplined practice and meditation) finds liberation (moksha) from the endless cycles of rebirth (samsara). It should be noted that in the Upanishads themselves, Brahman, the Ultimate Reality, is not personified or personalized; however, some later schools of Hindu thought did personalize this unified One Supreme Being, most typically as Shiva, Vishnu, or the Goddess.</p>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>Third are the two great Indian epics, the Mahabharata and the Ramayana. The Mahabharata, the oldest, has existed in various forms for well over two thousand years. It is the longest epic poem in the world, and is said to have been written by the great sage Vyasa. However, it is clear that the epic as it exists today has been redacted by many hands over the centuries. The main plot narrative concerns the rivalry between two sets of paternal first cousins: the five sons of Pandu (the Pandavas), led by Yudhishthira; and the one hundred sons of the blind King Dhritarashtra (he and his sons are called the Kauravas). However, within this overarching story, the reader finds elaborate side narratives on philosophy, ethics, and politics, and other stories only tangentially related to the main characters.<sup>12</sup></p>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>The most well-known portion of the Mahabharata is the Bhagavad Gita, and it is a particularly important text for this study of Krishna, as the story revolves around him. More will be said about both these texts in coming chapters; for now, let me simply summarize the action. After years of trickery, intrigue, and behind-the-scenes maneuvering, the Pandavas and the Kauravas find themselves on the brink of all-out war. The two massive armies face off on the Kurukshetra, "Kuru's field," for what will be the decisive battle for the entire Indian kingdom; it is clear the death-toll will be monstrous. At the very moment the battle is to commence, Arjuna, the Pandava's champion, loses heart: looking out across the field of battle he sees cousins, friends, and mentors, and the thought of killing them overwhelms him. Discouraged, he sits down in his chariot and refuses to fight. At this point, Krishna, who is acting as Arjuna's charioteer, preaches the most famous sermon in Hinduism, explaining to him why it is his duty to fight and why fighting in the battle will be an act of great religious significance. In the course of this sermon, Krishna reveals his true self to Arjuna as the one supreme reality—creator and destroyer of all. Arjuna then goes on to fight, helping his brothers win the war and the kingdom.</p>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">6.</span>In his book, Arrow of the Blue-skinned God, Jonah Blank writes,</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>Imagine a story that was the Odyssey, Romeo and Juliet, the Bible, and a Hollywood blockbuster all rolled into one. Imagine a story that combined adventure and aphorism, romance and religion, fantasy and philosophy. Imagine a story that could make young children marvel, grown men weep, and old women dream. Such a story exists in India, and it is called the Ramayana."<sup>13</sup></p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">7.</span>Along with the Mahabharata, the Ramayana is one of the most important epic poems in Hinduism. Its earliest form is a Sanskrit poem attributed to the sage Valmiki, and scholars believe that it was composed sometime between 500 BCE and 400 CE. However, as in the case of other texts, Hindu tradition places the date of composition much earlier. The story itself is about Prince Rama of Ayodhya, his wife Sita, her capture by the demon Ravenna, and her subsequent rescue by Rama, his brother Lakshmana, and their monkey helper Hanuman.<sup>14</sup> More broadly, however, the story models proper dharma—that is, the proper actions and behaviors required to maintain or uphold one's place in the world and to support the proper functioning of the cosmos as a whole. Rama, Sita, and the other main characters all exemplify proper dharma through the way in which they live as a husband, a wife, a brother, a king, a son, and so on. In all of their relationships, they demonstrate ideal social behavior. Thus, people today still model their own behavior on that of Rama and Sita.<sup>15</sup></p>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">8.</span>Finally, I want to mention the Puranas, a series of texts that describe specific gods in great detail, specifically Vishnu, Shiva, and Brahma, along with the way in which they are to be worshiped and what rewards devotees can expect to receive from them. As with the other sacred texts in Hinduism, a date of composition for the Puranas is difficult to establish. Freda Matchett surveys several different scholarly opinions, concluding that "It would be hard to disagree... that 'the most reasonable date' for the Bhagavata [the particular Purana that concerns Krishna] is 'the ninth or early tenth century."'<sup>16</sup> However, she also agrees with Friedhelm Hardy, who writes, "On the whole, it is meaningless to speak of 'the date' of a Sanskrit purana, because many generations of bards, etc., have been involved in the accumulation of material which at some stage has been given a name."<sup>17</sup></p>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">9.</span>While the list of Puranas is seemingly endless—"vast in extent and miscellaneous in content"<sup>18</sup>— the major Puranas are typically listed at eighteen, and these books are subdivided into three sets of six books each, with each set corresponding to one of the three gods mentioned above, although many texts also are devoted to worship of the goddess. One of the reasons why the Puranas are important for this particular study is that many scholars would agree that "it is an undeniable fact that the most popular and loved of the Puranas is the Bhagavata—also called the Shrimad Bhagavatam, which describes all of the ten principal avatars of Vishnu but at the same time gives primacy of place to Krishna." Obviously, this text is of particular concern here, and it is on this text that the biography of Krishna presented below will be based.</p>

                            <h5>3. A New Mindset</h5>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>This diversity points to the fact that, for Christians, a new mindset is required to get into a study of Hinduism, as practitioners of Hinduism do not share many of the core ontological and epistemological beliefs of Westerners. What I mean by this is that a Hindu understanding of the cosmos, human nature, and God is radically different from what is found in Christianity—and, for that matter, what is found in Islam and Judaism as well. In other words, "What we label 'Hinduism' ranges from monotheism to polytheism, from monism to materialism and atheism; from nonviolent ethics to moral systems that see as imperative elaborate blood sacrifices to sustain the world; from critical, scholastic philosophical discussion to the cultivation of sublime, mystical, wordless inner experiences."<sup>20</sup> Nowhere is this more obvious than with the understanding of God. Any introductory text on Hinduism must deal with the difficult question of how to explain the characterization of the Divine in Hinduism in a way Westerners can understand.</p>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>Hinduism accommodates a vast assortment of dynamic and multifaceted concepts of God. For the most part, gods can be categorized under two broad headings: Nirguṇa Brahman, a formless, impersonal supreme reality without qualities or attributes—comparable in some general way to what Christians call an apophatic understanding of the Divine; and Saguṇa Brahman, the personified, personal form of the supreme reality that is worshiped as god—what Christians call a kataphatic understanding of the Divine.</p>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>It is important to note that these are not two different realities, but rather two different ways of perceiving the one true ultimate reality: the first is perhaps more the subject of philosophical and intellectual speculation and meditation, while the second is more the object of adoration, sacrifice, and devotion. This particular study is more concerned with the personified conception of supreme reality and the consequent relationship that results between the god and the individual. Therefore, it is important to expand on the notion of Saguṇa Brahman, the idea of a personified god in Hinduism.</p>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>In order to appreciate a Hindu understanding of god, one must first move beyond the "either/or" of monotheism and polytheism: that is, one must let go of the idea that there are only two options— either people worship one god (monotheism) or they worship many gods (polytheism). Instead, in Hinduism, it is both/and. Hindus see no contradiction in believing that there is one god and believing that there are many gods. In addition, for some, the tension between the one and the many actually generates deeper insight into the true nature of the Divine than either one could produce on its own. Hence, Steven Rosen writes,</p>
                            <blockquote>
                                <p>To the Hindu mind, opposites are, in a sense, the same thing. They are different sides of the same coin—inseparable and fundamentally related. . . Thus, in Hinduism, the One and the Many might even function as synonyms—the One, say ancient Hindu texts, only fully reveals itself when in relation to the Other. . . This is to say, the Other gives meaning to the One, and vice versa. A fundamental Hindu perception: Opposites attract and interpenetrate each other. Ultimately, then, the One and the Other coalesce in a higher spiritual reality. This is expressed in various ways in the Hindu tradition.<sup>21</sup></p>
                            </blockquote>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>Hindu doctrine and practice, then, have a wide variety of ways of conceptualizing the Divine, including the following: monolatry, which points to the worship of one greater god among many lesser gods; kathenotheism or henotheism, which refer to the worship of different gods, but only one god at any given time; and finally, polymorphic monotheism, which signifies the worship of one supreme god who reveals him/herself in many forms in different times and places in the world.<sup>22</sup></p>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">6.</span>Part of the reason for this complexity is that the history of the various gods in Hinduism is very complicated, and the depiction of many, if not all, of the major deities has evolved over time, differing greatly depending on which sacred texts are being cited. This chronological diversity is accompanied by an equal geographical diversity: depending on where one is located, the actual worship of the different deities varies widely—not only across the globe, but even from north to south India. Finally, as noted above, the theology that informs people's understanding of the various gods in Hinduism is polyvalent: some people believe that all gods are simply different faces of the same one supreme being; others reject all personified forms of this one; some are devoted to one god exclusively; and others worship many different gods simultaneously.</p>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">7.</span>While this can seem terribly complicated and confusing—perhaps even heretical—to Western Christian ears, perhaps another way in which the concept of the Divine in Hinduism can be viewed is through the lens of hospitality. Steven Rosen argues that "The multiplicity or diversity of Hindu deities points to the tradition's spiritual hospitality, its willingness to accommodate personal proclivity, and tastes innumerable."<sup>23</sup> Perhaps Christians can practice their own version of spiritual hospitality here and attempt to understand this new way of thinking, and possibly even come to appreciate it.</p>

                            <h5>4. Who Is Vishnu?</h5>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>Unlike Christianity, which is grounded in a linear understanding of time, Hinduism has a cyclical understanding of time, in which the universe continually cycles into and out of existence over many eons. In most descriptions of this process, instead of there being one single divinity behind it all, there are three: Brahma is the creator, the one who brings the universe into being; Shiva is the destroyer, the one who, at the right time, causes the universe to fall into nothingness; and during the in-between-time stands Vishnu, the preserver, the god who sustains the universe and protects it from evil while it is in existence. Together, these three gods make up what is sometimes (and somewhat confusingly) called the Hindu "trinity," but the more accurate name in Hinduism is trimurti, which translates roughly as "three faces."</p>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>As should be expected, there are different understandings of what these gods represent and how they function. Some Hindus see all three gods as simply manifestations of one supreme being that is above all personification, but they still honor and worship the different manifestations individually as genuine representations of god— although it should be noted that today there is hardly any direct worship of Brahma alone. By contrast, both Shiva and Vishnu, as well as the goddess, who is personified with different names and in different forms, have millions of followers who worship him/her as the single supreme deity, the highest embodiment of the Divine. It lies outside the scope of this chapter to discuss how this worship functions in relationship to the goddess and Shiva, but Vishnu is a different case altogether, as is it impossible to understand Krishna without knowing something about Vishnu.</p>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>According to Rosen, "two-thirds of the known Hindu world identifies themselves as Vaishnavas,"<sup>24</sup> that is, worshipers of Vishnu. As noted above, Vaishnavas believe that Vishnu is the personal embodiment of the Divine—the highest form of the one supreme god himself who is the ground and source of all being. In terms of Hindu iconography and statuary, Vishnu is always depicted with dark skin—typically blue. He is usually shown with four arms, one holding a lotus flower, another holding a conch shell, another holding a disc or wheel, and the final arm holding a mace. Sometimes he is shown resting on the coils of a many-headed serpent, called Sheshanaga, and sometimes his consort, Lakshmi, is rubbing his feet—or sometimes she is sitting next to him. He also is depicted riding his "vehicle," the great eagle Garuda. Hinduism knows no prohibition against imaging the Divine, and in no other religion in the world is there such a profusion of depictions of the gods, in all manner of art forms, in all possible materials, from great stone statues to children's comic books.</p>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>The primary aspect of Vishnu's mythology that makes him relevant for this particular study is the doctrine of the avatar. Avatara is a Sanskrit word that refers to a divine incarnation (literally it means "one who descends"), and it is almost always associated with Vishnu. The word "incarnation" must be read and interpreted by Christians with care, however. Certainly, it is true that there are some general similarities with the concept of incarnation in Christianity, insofar as both refer to a divine decision to "come down" and dwell in creation. Nevertheless, there are many important differences as well, most notably the fact that, unlike Jesus, who according to Christian tradition was truly fully human (and fully divine), the avatar is more correctly viewed as an appearance of the Divine, something akin to the Greek god Zeus coming down from heaven disguised as a mortal, but ready and willing to throw off his human camouflage at a moment's notice if the need arises. Further, while Jesus is believed to be the unique incarnation of God, Vishnu is believed to have many, many different avatars.</p>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>The purpose for this "divine descent" is also different in Hinduism, having nothing to do with a doctrine of sin or human alienation from God. Instead, Hindus believe that at various times in the endless cycles of history Vishnu descends into the world in the form of some created being in order to save and preserve creation from a particular demonic force threatening the very existence of the cosmos. While, as noted above, there are many different avatars in Hinduism, tradition holds that there are ten primary avatars of Vishnu and their stories are told in elaborate detail both in the Puranas and in a variety of other sacred Hindu texts.</p>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">6.</span>The ten are as follows:
                                <ol>
                                    <li>first, the fish, Matsya, who saved the world from a great flood;</li>
                                    <li>second, the tortoise, Kurma, who allowed the gods and demons to churn up valuable objects from the ocean of milk using a pivot resting on his back;</li>
                                    <li>and third, the boar, Varaha, who also rescued the earth from a flood by raising it up on one of his trunks.</li>
                                    <li>Fourth is the man-lion, Narasimha, who came to deliver the world from a terrible demon who had obtained from the gods a special boon that prohibited him from being killed by a god, an animal, or a human; Narasimha was a combination of all these, and thus succeeded.</li>
                                    <li>Fifth is the dwarf, Vamana, who confronted another demon who had conquered the entire universe. He begged the demon-king for just as much land as he could cover with three of his dwarf steps, and the king, scoffing at such a request, granted it. Imagine his surprise when the dwarf covered the entire universe in his first two steps, placing his last step on the king's own head.</li>
                                    <li>Sixth is Parashurama, the man called "Rama with the axe," the hero who destroyed the entire Kshatriya class of warriors who were exploiting others.</li>
                                </ol>
                            </p>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">7.</span>The next two avatars, numbers seven and eight, are the most famous. First is Ramachandra—simply called Rama, the hero of the aforementioned Ramayana, who embodied in his person perfect obedience, dharma, filial love, and righteousness. He is still seen as the example par excellence for human conduct in Hinduism today. The eighth avatar is Krishna, who is not only viewed as the perfect and highest incarnation of Vishnu, but whose position in relation to Vishnu, according to many devotees, is reversed, with Krishna being worshiped as the one supreme god and the source of all incarnations, including Vishnu himself.<sup>25</sup> More will be said about this shortly.</p>
                            <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">8.</span>Finally, the last two avatars are ninth, the Buddha—in this way, Hinduism was able to enfold Buddhism as a whole under its large umbrella; and tenth, Kalki, the form of Vishnu who is still to come, and whose arrival will signal the end of the present age.</p>

He is believed by some to be among the several incarnations of Vishnu, by others to be a divine incarnation of unique and singular importance (as Jesus is to Christians), by others the highest and most perfect manifestation of Brahman, and by still others simply God, the Original and Supreme."<sup>27</sup> For those outside Hinduism, however, if they know anything about Krishna at all, it is typically through exposure to the great Hindu epic, the Mahabharata, where the Bhagavad Gita is located. This text reveals Krishna to be the Universal Divine Being, the reality containing all existence in himself. This is a key lens through which to view Krishna's salvific character, and this text, and his role in it, will be discussed in a later chapter.</p>
                    <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">10.</span>However, Steven Rosen notes that "while these images of Krishna are highly regarded by Hindus worldwide, his early life as a child and as a young lover is often held in greater esteem. Frolicking in the simple bucolic atmosphere of Vraja, in northern India, he captured the local people's hearts, and their descendants have been retelling his extraordinary pastimes ever since. It is this Krishna that is most loved in the Indian subcontinent."<sup>28</sup> It is this Krishna, then, who is the focus here.</p>
                    <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">11.</span>The bulk of this material of the life of Krishna can be found in book [or canto] ten of the Bhagavata Purana,<sup>29</sup> a text that has been described by more than one scholar as a kind of Hindu New Testament.<sup>30</sup> This particular Purana, which, as I noted earlier, details the various avatars of Vishnu, is believed to have been composed sometime between the sixth century and the eighth or ninth century CE., although some scholars date the earliest pieces of the text to the fourth century CE and the final composition to as late as the tenth century.<sup>31</sup> The Purana comprises 18,000 stanzas and is divided into twelve books, or cantos, all of which laud Vishnu and his different avatars.</p>
                    <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">12.</span>Even in the context of the whole of this large text, Krishna receives special treatment: he is "uniquely exalted here as the most perfect and complete earthly and transcendental manifestation of the Divine."<sup>32</sup> This is true of the whole, but it is particularly and inimitably true of the tenth canto. Here is how one scholar describes this particular section of the text:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                        <p>It has a magic about it. There is nothing you will ever read which quite resembles it, for it is unique in all world literature, sacred or secular. From a strictly aesthetic standpoint it is gloriously beautiful, but from a philosophical and religious standpoint it accomplishes something more amazing: it describes that which is indescribable, captures in time and space that which is eternal and infinite, makes understandable that which is inconceivable. The eternal Reality which the Upanishads suggest through abstraction and metaphor is made tangible in the person Krishna. We can, without performing a single meditation or making one inch worth of spiritual progress see, hear, feel and come to intimately know the Ultimate Truth."<sup>33</sup></p>
                    </blockquote>
                    <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">13.</span>The tenth canto itself is divided into two main parts. Part one, which is our primary concern here, describes Krishna's birth and childhood in Braj (also written as Vraja) or, more specifically, Vrindavana, and part two describes Krishna's adult life after leaving Vrindavana, his many marriages, and his vanquishing of many demons. The picture painted in part one in particular is of a beautiful, loving God at play, enjoying time with his devotees purely for the joy of it, without any hidden agenda or higher purpose.</p>
                    <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">14.</span>This concept of play, or līlā, is one of the key characteristics of Krishna, and one that will be discussed in depth in chapter 3. In fact, although the ostensible purpose for Krishna's incarnation, described in more detail in the Mahabharata and the Bhagavad Gita, is to rid the world of the increasing number of demons and demonic forces, another equally important purpose described in the Bhagavata Purana is to encourage loving relationships of devotion that ultimately lead to salvation. One of the primary means by which Krishna facilitates these relationships is through his acts of līlā with his devotees.</p>

                        <h5>5. A Dangerous Birth</h5>
                        <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>What is recounted in the Bhagavata Purana is presented as having occurred just before the onset of the Kaliyuga, the final age in the winding down of creation before its eventual destruction. It is believed that the inauguration of the Kaliyuga was, in fact, Krishna's departing this world and returning to his divine abode. The Bhagavata is told in the form of various narrations by the sage Suta, who has been asked to tell about Krishna's activities, since both the hearing and the speaking of Krishna's name are said to bring liberation, and meditation on his deeds is particularly auspicious.</p>
                        <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>The story begins with an explanation of why Krishna chose to become incarnate at that particular time. Suta relates that at one time the earth was greatly oppressed by wicked kings and demons. Taking the form of a cow, she appealed to Brahma, the god of creation, for assistance. Then Brahma, with Shiva and the other gods, prayed to Vishnu/Krishna, who is identified as "the supreme being, the Lord of the universe, the God of all gods."<sup>34</sup> He replied that the distress of the earth was already known to him, and he had already made plans to incarnate himself as the son of Vasudeva, along with his amsha, who becomes Balarama, his brother and his constant companion.</p>
                        <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>A quick word about this concept of amsha, which refers to a "portion" or "partial incarnation." Describing this idea, Edwin Bryant writes,</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>the sense of the term is that the supreme Godhead [who in the Bhagavata Purana is unquestionably Krishna] can maintain his (or her) own presence while simultaneously manifesting some aspect of himself (or herself) elsewhere in a separate and distinct presence (or any number of presences). That secondary, or derivative manifestation, which exhibits a part but not the full characteristics or potency of the source being, is known as an amsha.<sup>35</sup></p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>Balarama, then, is a partial incarnation of Krishna, a secondary manifestation that Krishna creates alongside his full incarnate form.</p>
                        <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>As the story begins, Vasudeva, the man who becomes Krishna's father, has just married a woman named Devaki, and she has a brother named Kamsa. As Vasudeva and Devaki are riding away from the marriage ceremony in their chariot, with Kamsa at the reins, a voice from the heavens announces that the eighth offspring of Devaki will become Kamsa's killer. (As the reader finds out soon enough, Kamsa is one of those wicked kings par excellence of whom the earth was complaining about to Brahma.) Kamsa comes close to killing Devaki right then and there, but Vasudeva, hoping to save his wife's life, promises that he will hand over to Kamsa every child that Devaki bears. Kamsa then agrees to spare Devaki, but imprisons both her and her husband, and kills each one of their children as they are born.</p>
                        <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">6.</span>After six of the infants have been killed and Devaki is pregnant with her seventh child, Krishna puts his master plan into action. He goes to Yogamaya, a feminine power of illusion that serves Krishna during his incarnation, and instructs her to spirit away the unborn child that is in Devaki's womb. This child is born as Balarama by another mother, Rohini, and everyone believes that Devaki has miscarried.</p>
                        <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">7.</span>Finally, Devaki becomes pregnant with Krishna, not by means of sexual intercourse, but by the "mental transmission" Of Vasudeva. Simply by the change in Devaki's appearance—her radiance and glow—Kamsa knows that the child she is carrying is Krishna, and he waits with impatience until Krishna is born, sure that he will be able to kill Krishna while he is an infant.</p>
                        <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">8.</span>When the time of Krishna's birth finally comes, Suta relates in detail the many auspicious signs that herald the birth of the supreme god of the universe: the sky was clear and full of stars, a fresh breeze blew, the minds of the sages were peaceful and calm, the birds were singing, and flowers rained down from heaven. Krishna was born at midnight, and although his parents for a brief moment saw him in his true form—four arms bearing weapons, a magnificent jewel around his neck, arm and wrist bracelets, beautiful earrings, and wearing a yellow garment—Krishna quickly cloaked himself in the guise of an ordinary child by the power of his Yogamaya illusion. One source describes the scene this way:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>At the moment of His birth, the prison was filled with a soft light, streaming out from the Babe Himself, and as He lay back in His mother's lap, they saw shining out from behind Him four arms. One hand held the Shankha or battle-trumpet; another the discus; a third the mace; and in the fourth was a lotus on its stem. Then Devaki and Vasudeva knew these for the signs of Vishnu, and they worshipped the child, saying the salutations, as Narayana, Savior of the World. But as the salutations ended, the veil of Maya descended upon them once more, and the Child appeared to them as their own babe.<sup>36</sup></p>
                        </blockquote>
                        <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">9.</span>The baby Krishna then instructs Vasudeva to remove him from the room (Krishna opens the bolted doors himself) and carry him to Vraj, to the house of Nanda and Yashoda. There, Yogamaya has just been born as a child of Yashoda; in the darkness, as everyone is sleeping, Vasudeva switches the children, laying Krishna in the arms of Yashoda and taking the infant girl, who is really the goddess Yogamaya, back to Devaki. As soon as the cries of the girl are heard in the household, Kamsa comes to kill the child. Taking her by her feet, he dashes her against a rock, and is astonished when Yogamaya reveals her true form, flying into the air and manifesting herself as a goddess. She then warns Kamsa that Krishna has already been born somewhere else. Kamsa responds by ordering all the babies who are ten days old or less in and around the area to be killed. Notwithstanding this order, Krishna survives, and embarks upon a marvelous childhood.</p>

                         <h5>6. A Divine Childhood</h5>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>Krishna's childhood is marked by mischievous play with Balarama (the seventh child conceived by Devaki), which both exasperates and delights his mother, Yashoda. Throughout, however, Krishna repeatedly gives glimpses of his true form, which reminds both readers and the other inhabitants of Vraj that, while he "behaves] as humans do," he does not, in fact, share true human nature.<sup>37</sup></p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>One of the first examples of Krishna's power comes in the form of his vanquishing the demoness Putana. One day, Putana changed into a beautiful woman who walked through Vraj, looking for children to kill. She came into Yashoda’s house and offered to nurse Krishna. Yashoda, believing her to be an eminent woman because of her beauty, agreed; but when Putana put Krishna to her breast, Krishna sucked not only the poison from her breast, but took her life breath as well. As she was dying, she turned back into her original form, horrible and terrifying to behold. The story, however, concludes with an unusual twist: in spite of her evil intention, because Krishna had suckled at her breast, she was immediately transported to svarga, the highest heaven. This illustrates that any type of contact with Krishna—indeed, even Kamsa's evil fixation on Krishna—can be salvific, because of who Krishna is.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>This echoes another nursing story (recounted in full in the introduction to this book) in which Krishna's true nature and power are revealed when Yashoda sees the whole universe in sleepy Krishna's yawning mouth.<sup>38</sup></p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>There are many stories like this in which Krishna reveals his true form to his mother—if only for a moment. One more tells of a time when Yashoda was churning butter, which Krishna especially loved. While she was churning, Krishna got hungry, grabbed the stick and got in her way. She took him onto her lap and let him nurse for a bit until she realized that the milk on the stove was boiling over, and so she put him down before he was full. This made him angry, so he picked up a rock and broke the butter churn, running with the butter into his hiding place so he could eat it. When Yashoda came back and saw what he has done, she laughed—she couldn't help it—and she found him feeding some of the butter to a monkey. When she finally caught him, she tried to bind him with a rope, so he couldn't do any more harm, but although she used rope after rope the length was not enough to contain him: "Krishna has no beginning and no end, no inside and no outside. He is the beginning and end and inside and outside of the universe. He is the universe."<sup>39</sup> At last, Krishna took pity on his mother and allowed himself to be bound.</p>

                        <h5>7. A Happy Cowherd</h5>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>In such manner, Krishna spends his first few years—"in youthful games such as playing hide-and-seek, building dams and jumping about like monkeys."<sup>40</sup> Shortly after this, when he is still a little boy, he and Balarama, "the sole keepers of the whole universe," become the caretakers of the calves in the forest of Vraj, "a place which brings happiness in all seasons."<sup>41</sup> During this time, it is clear how beloved Krishna is, not only by his human followers, but indeed by the whole creation—particularly by the calves he tends with the other cowherd boys. It is said:</p>
                         <blockquote>
                            <p>Even the grazing animals had a special love for the Lord, and lowed happily, whenever he caressed them, or came near, gathering about Him in a ring, to listen, whenever—standing with feet crossed beneath the beautiful Kadamba tree—He played upon His flute. Some say, indeed, that at such moments the lotus-buds lying on the Jamuna waters opened, and the river itself bent out of its straight course.<sup>42</sup></p>
                         </blockquote>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>While in the forest, he continues his playful antics, performing all sorts of amazing feats on a regular basis. For example, he kills the demon Baka, who has assumed the form of a great crane. The demon actually swallows Krishna, but only for a moment: Krishna is furious, and burns Baka's throat like fire, causing him to be disgorged. As Baka comes toward him again, Krishna effortlessly tears him apart by his beak, to great rejoicing by the other cowherd boys.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>Another interesting episode during this time illustrates how, in the Bhagavata Purana, Krishna is depicted as the supreme god above all gods. At one time, Brahma, the creator, comes to Vrindavana and leads away all the other young calf-herders and their calves. Krishna searches all over for them and cannot find them; immediately, he realizes what Brahma has done, and provides an astonishing solution:</p>
                         <blockquote>
                            <p>Thereupon Krishna, the Lord and maker of the universe, transformed his own self into both [the calves and the boys] in order to give pleasure to the mothers of those [calves and calf-herders] as well as to Brahma. He took the form of as many little bodies of calves and calf-herders as there were calves and calf-herders, with as many hands and feet and bodily parts . . . Then Krishna took care of his calves, who were his own self, by himself in the form of the calf-herders. The Self of everything entered Vraj, playing games with himself [in the form of the calves and boys].<sup>43</sup></p>
                         </blockquote>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>In other words, to avert any anxiety about the missing children and cows, Krishna manifests himself as each and every calf and boy for an entire year, fooling their mothers and all the people of Vraj. Brahma, seeing what Krishna has done, pays him homage, confessing that even he is not able to understand Krishna's greatness. Brahma worships Krishna, praising him as "the one self, the supreme being, ancient, the truth, self-effulgent, unlimited, original, eternal, imperishable, perpetually happy, Immaculate, complete, without a second, and free from limitations and death."<sup>44</sup></p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>Another famous story from this period of Krishna's life tells of his battle with Kaliya, the snake demon who was polluting the Yamuna River with his poison. The problem came to Krishna's attention when his fellow cowherds and their cows, made thirsty by the heat of the day, drank from the poisoned river and immediately fell down dead. Krishna did not let them lie lifeless for long: "A few minutes passed, however, and the tears of Krishna brought them all back to life. For His mercy and love could not fail to give life and strength, and He poured them out in abundance over His fainting friends."<sup>45</sup></p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">6.</span>His friends thus restored, Krishna took steps to purify the river and banish the snake. He climbed a tall tree, dove into the river, and immediately began to wrestle with the demon. Kaliya bit Krishna in his "tender parts" and coiled his body around him, distressing Krishna's friends on the shore who were watching the action. All of this was nothing but sport to Krishna, however, and the text makes clear that Krishna was never in any real danger. Instead, entirely without fear, he toyed with Kaliya, like a child plays with a rubber snake. Finally, Krishna climbed up on Kaliya's hoods (from this we assume Kaliya to be a many-headed cobra) and began to dance, his powerful feet crushing Kaliya's heads with each rhythmic step. Kaliya is thus "danced" into submission; recognizing Krishna's power, he worships Krishna and retreats to the ocean. The story concludes that the Yamuna River is freed from poison by the great lord who "assumed a human form for sport."<sup>46</sup></p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">7.</span>Stories like this fill Krishna's biography, consistently surprising those who forget that Krishna only appears to be a young boy; but for those who know his true identity, "there is nothing in this that is astonishing for Krishna. By his maya potency, he [appeared] as a small human boy, but he is the supreme creator of both the highest and the lowest."<sup>47</sup></p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">8.</span>Another key component in Krishna's life as a cowherd can be found in his relationship to the gopis, the cowherd girls who are devoted to him. One story in particular, in which Krishna dances with them, will be discussed at the end of this chapter; it is one of the two paradigmatic stories that will be mined for their salvific efficacy in the following chapter. However, a similar story can be told here. One day, the gopis were bathing naked in the river at sunrise, singing songs about Krishna, and thinking only of him. When Krishna and his young companions came upon them, he gathered up their clothes and climbed up a tree. The gopis were shivering in the water, but did not dare come out and retrieve their clothes and show their nakedness. Krishna laughed and teased them, telling them that if they were really his servants, they would do as he said and come out to get their clothes. At this, the gopis covered themselves as best they could with their hands and came out of the water. Krishna was pleased at this, and gave them back their clothes. The text says that while they certainly had cause to be angry, "they were not really upset with Krishna. They were delighted to be in the company of their darling."<sup>48</sup> This erotic play is a central way in which Krishna interacts with his devotees and reflects the passionate love he engenders in those who worship him—both men and women.<sup>49</sup></p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">9.</span>Krishna passes the rest of his childhood this way—enjoying the company of his brother Balarama, dispatching demons, playing with the gopis, and just generally delighting in his friends, the forest, and his own being. What's more, it is this "delight" that is at the heart of Krishna's existence during this time. The text is clear that Krishna's play is his purpose—it is not a means to an end, but the end itself: "Krishna’s entire sojourn in Vrindavana serves no 'purpose.' . . . Only when demons appear, in most cases sent by Kamsa to kill the child, are we reminded of Krishna's ostensible mission. The way in which Krishna deals with these adversaries, however, does not break the mood of playful freedom that fills Vrindavana while Krishna is there."<sup>50</sup></p>

                         <h5>8. Krishna's Adult Life and Death</h5>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>The event that marks the end of Krishna's childhood and the beginning of his adult life is his killing of Kamsa, the evil king who had tried to kill him at birth and never stopped trying to destroy him throughout his youth. Kamsa has decided to summon Krishna and Balarama to the city of Mathura, under the pretext of a public wrestling competition. Once they arrive, Kamsa plans to have them killed, one way or another, and then he will kill their relatives and all his enemies along with them. When Kamsa's messenger, Akrura, comes to the boys to explain what Kamsa wants—and what he has in store for them— they simply laugh and agree to come at once. They leave the forest, amidst much weeping by the gopis, and as they come into the city, the women immediately fall in love with Krishna and shower him with flowers from their windows.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>This scene echoes the same theme that can be found in many of the stories—Krishna is not only the most powerful god, the supreme god of the universe, but is also exceedingly beautiful, which is a central aspect of his perfection. David Kinsley writes,</p>
                         <blockquote>
                            <p>Another and obvious characteristic of the cowherd Krishna is his surpassing beauty. Beauty is not an attribute of Krishna alone. Many Indian gods are known for their beauty and grace. But Krishna surpasses them all. He is the embodiment of that otherworldly grace, that astonishing divine beauty that transcends the ordinary world and attracts all who behold it. His every characteristic is the most beautiful, the most relishable.<sup>51</sup></p>
                         </blockquote>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>After being adulated throughout the city, the boys come to the wrestling arena and the contest begins. At the gate of the arena, Krishna kills the great elephant, Kuvalayapida, who had been stationed there by Kamsa, and as they enter, it is clear to all that they are invincible, and the entire crowd is dazzled by their radiance: "At the sight of those two singular men, the people on the platforms—both country and city folk drank in their faces with their eyes but remained unsatisfied... Their faces and eyes bloomed with a surge of happiness. It was as if they were devouring [them] with their eyes, licking [them] with their tongues, smelling [them] with their noses, and embracing [them] with their arms."<sup>52</sup> The wrestling match begins and, one by one, Krishna and Balarama kill each of their adversaries, until the remaining wrestlers run away from the competition. At this point, Krishna confronts Kamsa directly, killing him quickly, ending his evil reign.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>This more or less ends part one. The story continues in part two, but in a very different vein. It begins with Krishna meditating on the purpose for his descent to earth—to remove the evil kings, relieve the burden of the earth, and protect the righteous. (It should be noted that this purpose complements, but does not supersede, the "purpose" of play for which Krishna also came to earth. Even in part two, Krishna is described as the one "whose human form is for the purpose of sport."<sup>53</sup>) This part of Krishna's story climaxes in the events of the Mahabharata, particularly the Bhagavad Gita, but part two also describes at length how Krishna defeats the various wicked kings who cross his path.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>In addition, part two also is taken up with the description of Krishna's various marriages, as he seems to fulfill the proper dharma of a householder. However, as in part one, the reader is reminded repeatedly that Krishna only appears to be a mortal husband; in reality, he is perfectly self-contained and only acting a part—or, more accurately, acting 16,000 parts, which is the number of wives Krishna takes. With the same powers of illusion he showed as a boy, he manifests himself to each wife individually so that each thinks that he is hers alone. The text reports that Krishna has his own private inner city in Dvaraka, in which were found 16,000 different palaces, where Krishna lived simultaneously with each wife: "Thus, following the ways of humans, [Krishna] manifested his shakti powers for the liberation of everyone. He enjoyed himself with 16,000 of the choicest women . . . delighting in their laughter, their glances, their affection and their shyness."<sup>54</sup></p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">6.</span>Book ten of the Bhagavata Purana ends with an exhortation to surrender to Krishna and to listen to a retelling of his deeds: "By thinking about, reciting and hearing the beautiful stories of [Krishna], which constantly become more in number, a person [attains to] his incomparable abode, and overcomes death."<sup>55</sup></p>

                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>An account of Krishna's death appears in book eleven, which recounts that after Krishna had fulfilled the mission for which he came to earth, the creator god Brahma and the other gods came to see him at his home in Dvaraka. After a lengthy discourse of praise and adulation, Brahma said,</p>
                         <blockquote>
                            <p>O master, we previously asked you to remove the burden of the earth, a task which has now been accomplished, O unlimited soul . . . Assuming an incomparable form, you incarnated in the Yadu dynasty and performed extraordinary deeds for the benefit of the world. . . Nothing of the world of the gods remains to be done, O support of everything . . . Therefore, return to your supreme abode, if you care to, and protect us, the rulers of the worlds, along with the worlds.<sup>56</sup></p>
                         </blockquote>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>Krishna agrees that the time is right for him to return to the heavens. After a long discourse to his faithful follower Uddhava about the nature of reality and the means to liberation, Krishna allows events to unfold that he knows will lead to his death. It is important to note that in what follows, at every step of the way, Krishna is in full control of the proceedings: nothing happens that he is not aware of, and nothing occurs that he does not permit. There is no question of assuming that somehow Krishna is overpowered or surprised by forces beyond his control. Even in death, Krishna remains the supreme ruler of the cosmos.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>First, through his power of illusion, Krishna allows the warriors of his own dynasty, the Yadus, to destroy themselves through infighting. This was to fulfill a curse that had been put on them by a group of sages, a curse that Krishna knew about and permitted, and also to ensure that he did not leave another powerful dynasty upon the earth to become another burden. When this was accomplished, Krishna sat down under a banyan tree in meditation, with one foot crossed over the other, manifesting himself in his true form, just as he did at birth.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>A hunter named Jara mistakenly thought Krishna's "reddish lotus foot" was a deer and shot him—another event that Krishna both permitted and desired. As he was preparing to ascend to his heavenly abode, the gods gathered, eager to see his departure from earth. The text records that they were "crowding the sky with rows of celestial vehicles, and filled with great devotion, they showered down streams of flowers."<sup>57</sup> Then, through his powers of concentration, he ascended into heaven, but no one was able to see him, not even the gods, "since his path is unknown. As mortals cannot trace the path of a moving lightning flash which has left a ring of clouds, so the path of Krishna could not be traced by the gods."<sup>58</sup></p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>Today, Krishna is remembered in the Hindu calendar first and foremost on his birthday, which is celebrated in August or September in a festival called Janmashtami. The Janmashtami celebration takes place over two days, during which time Hindus are likely to forego sleep and instead sing traditional Hindu songs that celebrate Krishna. It is believed that Krishna was born at midnight and this is when the true festivities commence. Food is prepared from milk and curds, which Krishna particularly favored. Dances and songs are used to venerate and remember him, and plays are also carried out to reenact particularly memorable scenes from Krishna's childhood. In temples, images of Krishna are bathed and placed in cradles, and special mantras are also chanted.</p>

                     <h3>3. Two Key Stories of Krishna's Childhood</h3>
                     <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>With this background in place, we turn to a soteriological question to reflect upon what is "saving" about Krishna's life, and what is salvific about the relationship that he has with his devotees. Two well-known stories from Krishna's childhood are in many ways paradigmatic for teasing out the theological and soteriological meaning of Krishna's young life.</p>

                     <section id="ch2-sec3-10">
                         <h4>10. The Vision of the Universal Form</h4>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>This first story is easily one of most famous stories in Krishna's biography. Incidentally, it also has important resonances with another theophany (divine revelation) of the same name that occurs in the context of a conversation between Krishna and Arjuna in the Bhagavad Gita. That text and that particular episode will be discussed at length in a later chapter.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>The background to this particular story is the love Krishna's mother, Yashoda, has for her son and, indeed, the love all the gopis have for Krishna, even when they become exasperated at his playfulness. It is clear in the Krishna mythology that Yashoda's love for Krishna is meant to be exemplary, reminding all Krishna's devotees that the sheer joy and delight a mother takes in her child should be part of the love one experiences for Krishna. As Diana Eck writes:</p>
                         <blockquote>
                            <p>Hindu Vaishnavas insist that the most spontaneous and unconditioned love is that of parents for a child, and the adoration of the child Krishna in the Hindu tradition is very popular. In every Vaishnava household one would very likely find one particular figure among the murtis, the "images," on the home altar: the child Krishna on his hands and knees, crawling with a ball of butter in one hand. He is affectionately called makan chor, the "butter thief" who manages to get his little hand into the pot of freshly churned butter no matter how assiduously his mother tries to keep it out of his reach. She scolds him, but even in her scolding it is clear that the naughty little Krishna has stolen more than butter. He has stolen hearts.<sup>59</sup></p>
                         </blockquote>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>The story is told that one time when Balarama and Krishna were playing with the other boys, Balarama and the others complained that Krishna had eaten mud. Yashoda was concerned about Krishna's wellbeing and, taking him by the hand, she scolded him for what he had done. Krishna, however, protested: "Mother, I didn't eat any mud. They are all spreading false accusations. If you think they are speaking the truth, then you look into my mouth yourself." "If that is the case, then open wide," she said. The story goes on:</p>
                         <blockquote>
                            <p>Lord Hari [Krishna], whose supremacy cannot be constrained, but who is God assuming the form of a human boy for play, opened wide. Yashoda saw there the universe of moving and non-moving things; space; the cardinal directions; the sphere of the earth with its oceans, islands and mountains; air and fire; and the moon and the stars. She saw the circle of the constellations, water, light, the wind, the sky, the evolved senses, the mind, the elements, and the three guṇa qualities [goodness, action, and inertia]. She saw this universe with all of its variety differentiated into bodies, which are the repositories of souls. She saw the time factor, nature and karma. Seeing Vraj as well as herself in the gaping mouth in the body of her son, she was struck with bewilderment: "Is this actually a dream? Is it a supernatural illusion, or is it just the confusion of my own intelligence? Or is it, in fact, some inherent divine power of this child of mine? Therefore, I offer homage to his feet, which are the support of this world. From them, and through their agency, this world manifests. Their true nature cannot be known by the senses nor by reason. They are very difficult to perceive by thought, words, deeds or intellect. He is my refuge. Through his illusory power arise ignorant notions such as: I am me; he over there is my husband; and this is my son; I am the virtuous wife, protectress of all the wealth of the ruler of Vraj; and all the gopis and gopas, along with the wealth derived from the cattle, are mine." Then the omnipotent supreme Lord cast his yogamaya [divine power of illusion] in the form of maternal affection over the gopi [his mother Yashoda], who had come to understand the truth. Immediately, the Gopi’s memory was erased. She sat her son on her lap and returned to her previous state of mind, with her heart full of intense love. She considered Hari [Krishna], whose glories are sung by the three Vedas, the Upanishads, Sankhya yoga and the Satvata sages to be her very own son.<sup>60</sup></p>
                         </blockquote>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>The meaning of this story is clear, and emphasizes the same point that was made in the previous infancy narrative, recounted in the introduction: while Krishna might have the appearance of a baby, he is still the supreme lord of the cosmos. For a moment, then, the mind of Yashoda was illumined and she understood the true nature of her son—and indeed the true nature of reality—but only for a moment. This story concludes by explaining how Krishna caused his mother's mind to be erased, so that once again, she understood herself simply to be a mother holding her infant son on her lap.</p>

                         <h4>11. The Rasa-līlā</h4>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>A second significant story is called Krishna's rasa-līlā, which means "pastime play," and refers specifically to his dance with the gopis, the young girls herding cows. Diana Eck describes it this way:</p>
                         <blockquote><p>"In one of the most beloved episodes [of Krishna's life], Hindus recall how Krishna the cowherd used to beckon the milkmaids to the forest in the middle of the night to dance the great circle dance. They came, risking everything, and Krishna miraculously multiplied himself to dance with each and every one of them."</p></blockquote>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>According to Hindu tradition, this episode in Krishna's life is said to have occurred when he was between seven and ten years old. When reading the story for the first time, it is helpful to keep Krishna's age in mind, as well as the purity of his love, since, for Christian ears, there is an erotic flavor to this story that seems quite inappropriate for the Divine. However, it is a misinterpretation to attribute to Krishna any impure or carnal motives in his interaction with the gopis. As Steven Rosen writes, "The tradition is clear that Krishna has no prurient interest, nor does he have lascivious motives, at least not as commonly understood. His love for the gopis, and theirs for him, is pure."<sup>62</sup></p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>Indeed, in one account of this story, the love the gopis have for Krishna is described in terms of pure joy and light:</p>
                         <blockquote>
                            <p>Most wonderful of all was the love that the Gopis had for Him, as they romped and frolicked and tended the herds in the beautiful forests of Vrindaban. It was a love without any selfishness. When Krishna was near, they felt themselves lifted into a golden atmosphere, where all was gaiety and lightness of heart; nothing seemed serious or troublesome; and their happiness bubbled over in the form of gentleness and play.<sup>63</sup></p>
                         </blockquote>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>In the Bhagavata Purana, the story of Krishna's rasa-līlā is told over several chapters, beginning with Krishna playing his flute, enticing the gopis to come join him in the forest under the full moon. Upon hearing the music, all the women immediately drop whatever they are doing—milking cows, cooking, eating, putting on makeup—and go to be near Krishna: They are "in a state of rapture." Even those who cannot be with Krishna in person, but only meditate on him from their homes have "left their bodies" and, united with him, relate to him as their supreme lover. Krishna teases them, plays with them, embraces them, and sings with them. At one point, he vanishes, causing the gopis to search longingly for him, acting out his miraculous deeds and praising him in song, longing for his return and saying, "Your Lordship is our life." As they continue to sing, weeping, Krishna reappears in their midst—immediately changing their sorrow to joy—and once again delights in their company on the banks of the Yamuna River. At this point, the rasa dance begins:</p>
                         <blockquote>
                            <p>Govinda [Krishna] began the rasa pastime there, in the company of those devoted jewels of women, who linked arms happily together. The festival of the rasa dance began, featuring a circle of gopis. The Lord of all yogis, Krishna, inserted himself between each pair of gopis, and put his arms about their necks. Each woman thought he was at her side only... There was a tumultuous sound of bracelets, ankle-bracelets and the bells of the young women in the circle of the rasa dance with their beloved. Krishna Bhagavan, the son of Devaki, was radiant in their company, like a great emerald in the midst of golden ornaments... They were intent on amorous pleasure and overjoyed by Krishna's touch... The gopis, with glowing faces, cheeks adorned with locks of hair, and lotus flowers behind their ears, were beautiful. They danced with the Lord in the circle of the rasa to the musical accompaniment of the bees complemented by the sound of their anklets and bangles. Wreaths of flowers fell from their hair. Thus Krishna: the Lord of Lakshmi, sported with the beautiful girls of Vraj with freely playful smiles, amorous glances, and with caresses and embraces. He was like a child enraptured by his own reflection.</p>
                            <p>Although content within himself, the Lord became manifest in as many forms as there were gopi women, and enjoyed himself with them in līlā pastimes.<sup>64</sup></p>
                         </blockquote>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>Krishna, it is said, "lives within the gopis, their husbands and all living beings. He is the supreme witness who has assumed a form in this world for the purpose of sport. Manifest in a human form, he indulges in such pastimes as a favor to the devotees. Hearing about these, one becomes fully devoted to him."<sup>65</sup> How and why Krishna's interactions with his mother and with the gopis are salvific, and what they say about who Krishna is and how he saves will be the subject of chapter 3.</p>

                    <p>6. Blessed, says Sur, is one instant of this joy. Why live a hundred eons more?<sup>1</sup></p>
                </blockquote>
                <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">7.</span>The previous chapter introduced the reader to Krishna, setting him in context with a brief overview of Hinduism, a short discussion of Vishnu, the god of whom Krishna is believed to be an avatar, or incarnation, and then outlining a general biography of Krishna's life, taken primarily from the tenth book of the Bhagavata Purana, an unabashedly Vaishnava text.<sup>2</sup> The chapter ended with a detailed narration of two of the most well-known and important stories from Krishna's childhood: the theophany of his universal form to his mother Yashoda, and his rasa-līlā—his playful dance with the gopis. It is now time to examine those stories in light of soteriology, asking what significance they have for understanding how Krishna saves, and what salvation looks like in the life of his devotees.</p>
                <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">8.</span>Three primary soteriological insights can be drawn from these two stories in particular, as well as Krishna's young life as a whole. First, Krishna's līlā—the playfulness that characterizes so much of his childhood—tells us about who Krishna is and how he saves, and also what this means in the life of his devotees. In particular, I suggest that his playfulness creates a bond with his devotees, calling them into a relationship with him. In more general terms, Krishna's play is what breaks down the barriers that keep individuals from coming to be in relationship with God.</p>
                <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">9.</span>This leads directly into the second point, the kind of relationship Krishna facilitates with those who worship him. I maintain that the young Krishna does not desire to be worshiped in awe, nor does he desire to be feared; instead, Krishna desires that his devotees enter into an intimate relationship of pure love and devotion with him, modeled on the relationships a mother has with her child and a woman has with her lover. This particular invitation is what moves his devotees to love him wholeheartedly and devote themselves to him completely. Again, in more general terms, it is this relationship that allows individuals to give their lives over to God.</p>
                <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">10.</span>Finally, these stories provide an insight into the true nature of reality. The ultimate goal for Hindus is to be released from the endless cycles of rebirth and the suffering that characterizes this existence. In creating this deep devotion among his devotees, Krishna is able to turn people away from the illusory pleasures of this world and their clinging to material existence in order to fix their minds on God and the divine abode that will be their eternal home. In other words, Krishna reveals to individuals the true nature of existence and teaches them to focus their hearts and minds on what really matters, the supreme one who will finally release them from suffering.</p>

                <section id="ch3-sec4">
                     <h4>4. The Saving Grace of Līlā, or Play</h4>
                     <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>As noted in chapter 2, the young Krishna is particularly beloved by Hindus. Even though his adult life, particularly as recounted in the Bhagavad Gita, is also well-known and celebrated, by general consensus, "it is apparent, nevertheless, that the Hindu tradition at a very early date bracketed Krishna's childhood and youth. . . as the most sublime aspect of his biography or revelation."<sup>3</sup> Moreover, when one examines the stories told about that time in Krishna's life, the one word that occurs over and over in the texts is "playful." It is the adjective used to describe him in practically all of his youthful exploits, not only when he is with his family and friends, but also when he is dispatching this or that demon. The stories make clear that even when engaged in such life-and-death matters, Krishna's own playful attitude and the spirit of play that surrounds him are not altered.<sup>4</sup></p>
                     <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>Yet, after the end of part one in the tenth book of the Bhagavata Purana, the word hardly shows up again—and it never appears in the Bhagavad Gita. Clearly, then, this word points to a unique quality that characterizes Krishna during this specific time in his life—his infancy and youth. Just as clearly, there is something "sublime" about this playfulness that has been picked up and celebrated by Hindus throughout the centuries.</p>
                     <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>By contrast, the words "play" and "playful" are never used to describe Jesus in the Bible—and in fact, I would venture to guess that in over two millennia of writing and teaching in the Christian tradition, those words can't have been used in a Christological context over a handful of times, if even that many. All the more reason, then, why Christians should learn more about Krishna, "the divine player par excellence of Indian religion,"<sup>5</sup> and come to understand what saving significance such divine play might have. It is helpful, then, to take a closer look at this concept of play and to elaborate on how it draws individuals to Krishna and how it creates the possibility of a loving relationship with him. I maintain that this occurs through two insights: first, the revelation that God is joyful, and second, the transcendence of the distance between God and humanity, which creates feelings of deep affection for God.</p>

                    <section id="ch3-sec4-12">
                         <h5>12. What Does the Word "Play" Mean?</h5>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>In his discussion of the term līlā, Edwin Bryant notes that "unlike the term 'sport' or even 'game,' then, which might contain a suggestion of drivenness or competition, līlā is pure play, or spontaneous pastime"—it is God rejoicing in creation simply from "fullness of spirit."<sup>6</sup> Some analogies from human experience can help illustrate what is being described here. Līlā refers to the exhilaration of children playing in the year's first big snowfall. Līlā refers to the joy of relaxing in warm ocean waves under bright sunshine. Līlā refers to the happiness a mother gets from cooing at her infant, making faces at him, and delighting in his returned smile. Līlā refers to the pleasure lovers feel in each other's company, waking up together in the morning and talking softly about nothing while lying in each other's arms. Līlā, then, has no ulterior motive and no additional purpose other than the simple experience of joy—far from being simply a means to an end, līlā is the end: the play is the point.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>This is one reason why most children play much better than most adults: once you are an adult, work replaces play as your primary mode of activity in the world. The driving question motivating your doings becomes, "What I am producing?" Adults are taught that their activity needs to have a goal, an assessable outcome, a product, while the very definition of play is opposed to such ends. Children, however, are under no such pressures—and if they are, it is a sad commentary on today's society. Instead, play is integral to the whole concept of what it means to be a child. Children live in the moment and they do not need a reason for playing with modeling clay, watching birds build a nest, riding a bike through the neighborhood, or building a fort with blankets and couch cushions. The sheer enjoyment of the experience is the whole point.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>Thus, coming back to Krishna, this applies to his young life as well. In these years, Krishna literally lives for enjoyment, for pleasure, for play, and for delight. During his idyllic time in Vraj, this delight is his raison d'étre. Without a doubt it is what makes this period in Krishna's life so unique and sets it apart from the rest of his time on earth. While the Bhagavad Gita is explicit and emphatic that the purpose of Krishna's incarnation is to rid the earth of evil kings, and while even in the Bhagavata Purana as a whole it is clear that Krishna has come to earth to destroy the demons and protect the righteous, part one of the Purana, the section that describes Krishna's youth, gives primacy of place to another purpose: "Krishna descends to engage in līlā, or devotional pastimes."<sup>7</sup></p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>Līlā is the whole point of Krishna's young life, and it has a special function, creating the conditions for a unique experience that Krishna shares with his followers: "Līlā, then, is an opportunity for Krishna and his devotees to enjoy themselves in the blissful and spontaneous reciprocation of love."<sup>8</sup> In the end, then, it seems fair to say that līlā is nothing more and nothing less than the unique form of Krishna's love that draws his followers to him, like the flame drawing in a moth. This love creates the conditions for a singular experience of salvation.</p>

                    <section id="ch3-sec4-13">
                         <h5>13. Play as the Expression of the Divine Nature</h5>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>Any revelation of God always reveals something of Godself, even when the revelation itself aims at a different purpose. To take an example from the Judeo-Christian tradition, when God speaks to Moses from the burning bush, (at least) two things stand at the heart of that revelation. Ostensibly, the purpose of the revelation is to give Moses the specific instructions he is to follow in order to lead the Hebrew people out of their slavery in Egypt. But, first and foremost, God reveals something of God's true nature: God is the One who hears God's people in compassion and responds to their prayers; God is the One who is both just and merciful, and God is the great I AM WHO I AM, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, who forever remembers the covenant God has made with the people. This revelation, then, not only reveals what God wants of Moses and what God's plan is for God's people, but who God is Godself.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>In this same way, then, this divine revelation of Krishna reveals Krishna to be a god of play: playful creativity is Krishna's inherent nature. When we then extrapolate from this particular revelation to a more general concept of God, we can posit that Krishna also reveals play itself as a key attribute of divinity. In his study of Krishna's līlā, David Kinsley writes, "While play is perhaps not a classic feature of the divine in all religions, in Hinduism it is typical of the gods and represents, I think, an appropriate expression of the unconditioned and transcendent nature of the divine in India."<sup>9</sup> Again, this idea of playfulness as a divine attribute is something we find almost nowhere in the Christian tradition. Thus, it behooves us to ask what the language of playfulness suggests about God's nature and God's activity in the world. Taking Krishna as our example, we can see how his playfulness reveals divine freedom, divine movement, and divine beauty.</p>

                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>First, the concept of divine play points to a God who is inherently free, inherently unconditioned, and inherently joyful, taking delight in God's own being, God's own creation, and God's own movement in the world. God does not need a reason for activity, and God does not need to justify God's dynamism with a purpose or a plan. As noted before, the play is the point, and God delights in it just as children do. Kinsley writes,</p>
                         <blockquote>
                            <p>Play, just as much as power, knowledge, and eternity, expresses the truth that the gods are not limited. For play expresses freedom; it is carefree and relatively unmotivated. Play is done for the fun of it, for no ulterior reason. As opposed to most other types of activity, it is intrinsically satisfying rather than instrumental. It is an end in itself.<sup>10</sup></p>
                         </blockquote>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>Krishna reveals to us a God who, like a child, laughs simply for the delight of hearing his own voice, runs simply for the joy of feeling her legs beneath her, and splashes around in a river simply for the pleasurable cool of the water on his body. As children take delight in simply being alive, so Krishna takes delight in simply being incarnate in the world.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>It is worth noting that the language used in Hinduism to describe this playfulness goes far beyond what is found in Christianity. Take this example, for instance:</p>
                         <blockquote>
                            <p>The essential nature of the divine is shown to "exert" itself for no pragmatic purpose. It is shown to revel in its own incomparable joyful being by playing with itself, making love to itself, inciting itself to abandon itself. Krishna, the playful, charming cowherd boy who sports in Vrindavana, expresses the truth that the divine is most completely itself when it dallies aimlessly, overflowing itself in self-delight and self-generated rapture.<sup>11</sup></p>
                         </blockquote>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>It is hard to imagine a Christian theologian describing God as "making love to" Godself, and this sort of ecstatic abandon and "self-generated rapture" is more typically seen as a response to God, rather than God's own action. In the mystical tradition; for example, imagery of love-making, rapture, and delight is common on the part of human beings. However, Christians might have something to gain from this language even as it refers to God's own activity. As banal as it might sound, Krishna's līlā reveals to us a God who is happy, who enjoys the experiences God has in the world with God's creation, and who takes intrinsic delight in being vibrant in the world. While Christians are used to describing God's "work" in the world, how would our understanding of God change if, taking a page from our Hindu brothers and sisters, we talked instead about God's "play" in the world?</p>

                         <h5>15. Divine Movement</h5>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>Second, the concept of divine play suggests a God who is inherently in motion, not detached, impassive, and static. Krishna reveals a god who is "not restful, silent, and still in its essence but constantly and restlessly moving in ecstatic play."<sup>12</sup> This image of God stands in sharp contrast to Greek philosophical concepts of a God who is an "unmoved mover," entirely removed from the world, and unaffected by the activities of creation. Instead, Krishna provides an image of God who is fully engaged with the world, thoroughly involved in the lives of God's creatures, and endlessly creative in God's activities. Because God is perfectly free, unconstrained, and ceaselessly generative, God's dynamism points to God's inherent creativity, through which God is continually doing a new thing in the world, continually bringing what is unique and original into being. This serves as a reminder that God is always present in the world in an active rather than a passive way, and that God always can be counted on to express Godself—to make the divine presence felt and known and to interact with God's creatures.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>This dynamism is seen repeatedly in the stories of Krishna's youth as over and over Krishna engages the people of Vraj in endearing, surprising ways.</p>
                         <blockquote>
                            <p>The theophany of the child Krishna, then, expresses the nature of the divine as unconditioned . . . For the divine to become embodied as a child is eminently suitable, for they behave in similar ways. Each belongs to a joyous realm of energetic, aimless, erratic activity that is pointless, yet significant: pointless, but at the same time imaginative and rich, and therefore creative.<sup>13</sup></p>
                         </blockquote>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>Krishna's playfulness and energetic engagement with the world continue to be celebrated today among Hindus, particularly in the festival of Holi. This festival has its roots in a variety of different religious celebrations, but today it is primarily associated with Krishna.<sup>14</sup> The celebration, which can last up to sixteen days in some regions of India, occurs in the early spring. Three components of the festival are particularly relevant here. First is the overarching mode of rebellion and defiance of social norms. During Holi, a general mood of playfulness reigns, with more open flirting, mischievousness, and a loosening of social restrictions based on age, economic status, and gender. A second component involves throwing colored powder, paints, and water. Men and women both enjoy ambushing friends and strangers alike in the street and dousing them with a rainbow of colors. It is this practice that gives Holi the name, "the Festival of Colors." Third is the role of images of Krishna and his most beloved gopi lover, Radha. In some places, these images are swung together or paraded through the street while revelers dance around them, sing, and smear the images with colored powders. The celebration of Krishna's and Radha's love inspires a spirit of teasing and merrymaking that infects everyone around.<sup>15</sup></p>

                         <h5>16. Divine Beauty</h5>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>A third divine attribute of play in Krishna's case is the link between God's playfulness and God's beauty. Krishna's beauty is legendary, and almost all descriptions of him emphasize his physical loveliness.<sup>16</sup> The connection between divine play and beauty concerns the non-utilitarian aspect of both—neither exists for some ulterior purpose or for some specific function or role. Instead, both beauty and play are ends in and of themselves. They exist for their own sake: "For beauty, like play, is an end in itself. It strives for nothing, achieves nothing. It is apart from the instrumental world of necessity. It belongs to that other world of abundance. It is part of a world of effortless grace, an ornamental thing that justifies itself by simply being, and so like play belongs appropriately to the divine sphere."<sup>17</sup></p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>The idea of beauty as a divine attribute is certainly not unknown to Christianity; indeed, the entire discipline of theological aesthetics is concerned with the connection between God and beauty. God has always been seen as both the source and the highest expression of the True, the Beautiful, and the Good.<sup>18</sup> What is different in the case of Krishna is the way in which Krishna's beauty is linked to his physical appearance: his body, his face, and his desirability. In other words, there is a blatantly erotic character to Krishna's beauty. Here is an example from the Gopalavimshati, a fourteenth-century South Indian poem written by Venkatanatha, commonly known as Deshika:</p>
                         <blockquote style="font-size: 11pt; border-left: none; margin-left: 1em;"> <!-- Adjusted style for poem -->
                            <p>1. On his ears hang rings of langali flowers; His dark hair shines with feathers of a peacock</p>
                            <p>2. And thick red bandhujiva [hibiscus] blossoms;</p>
                            <p>3. He holds the playful shepherd's crook</p>
                            <p>4. In the tender sprout of his right hand;</p>
                            <p>5. His other hand fondles the slender shoulders of the lady who thrills at his touch—</p>
                            <p>6. The hairs on her body shining stand erect.</p>
                            <p>7. Lovely, dark as the monsoon cloud,</p>
                            <p>8. His flute tucked into the folds of his yellow waist-cloth,</p>
                            <p>9. And his hair shimmering with garlands of gunja-beads, Praise Him, tender lover of the gopis.<sup>19</sup></p>
                         </blockquote>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>To most Christians, this description might seem decidedly undivine, and more fitting for secular poetry than sacred text. However, Christians should remember the Song of Solomon before passing too censorial a judgment on these words. Many noted Christian theologians, particularly those in the Middle Ages such as Bernard of Clairvaux, believed that the erotic language of the Song of Solomon describes with deep meaning and insight the relationship between God and the soul. So, too, for Krishna, since his beauty is a means through which he expresses his playful nature, drawing his devotees to himself:</p>
                         <blockquote>
                            <p>For of all the Hindu gods Krishna expresses most completely all that is beautiful, graceful, and enticing in the other world of the divine. He embodies all those things that are extra in life, all those luxuries and characteristics that are not necessary to life but without which life would not be worth living. He is witty, gay, careless, accomplished at dancing, singing, and playing the flute. He is loved with abandon and loves with abandon. He is surpassingly beautiful. He is irresistibly and bewitchingly charming. All that he does is executed with effortless grace and harmony.<sup>20</sup></p>
                         </blockquote>

                         <h5>17. Play as Transcending Distance</h5>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>The attractiveness of Krishna's beauty leads to the next important aspect of Krishna's līlā, and that is the way he uses his playful antics to transcend the distance between the human and the Divine. Barbara Powell describes Krishna's behavior this way:</p>
                         <blockquote>
                            <p>Naughty Krishna, though exasperating, brings supreme joy to His elders. Their anger never lasts long. He bats His lotus-like eyes, pouts His pretty lips, sheds a few counterfeit tears and before you know it the adult is overcome with love and sweeps the child up in her arms. The naughtiness is also partly a guise designed to obscure His Godhead from them. Were His contemporaries aware of His true identity, they would be too overawed to exchange the natural loving intimacies for which He incarnated Himself. They must mistake Him for an ordinary boy and so, like a regular boy, Krishna is sometimes a pest.<sup>21</sup></p>
                         </blockquote>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>Contrast this to the Christian tradition, even in the most loving and personal descriptions of Jesus Christ: the aspect of awe and majesty that Jesus evokes are never entirely absent. One simple example will suffice. Martin Luther wrote his Small Catechism as a teaching tool not only for pastors to use in churches and schools but particularly for ordinary people to use at home and with their children. Here, then, we can expect that the Christian faith will be presented in its simplest form, straightforward and clear, focusing only on what is absolutely necessary to know and remember. It is significant, then, that Luther begins every one of his very brief explanations of each of the Ten Commandments with the words, "We are to fear and love God." I find it striking that even when teaching young children about God, and presumably wanting to instill positive feelings for God, Luther emphasizes that fear is a necessary and integral part of our relationship with God.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>Of course, Christians know that they are not meant to interpret this religious type of fear in the same way that one might describe one's fear of strangers, of the dark, or of spiders. Instead, the reminder that Christians are to fear God serves to emphasize the awe and wonder one should maintain when coming before God. In his classic text, The Idea of the Holy, Rudoph Otto famously described the encounter with the Holy as an experience of the numinous—the aspect of the Divine that is a mysterium tremendum, a mystery that both draws one in and frightens one away. The response to such a God, described in one famous hymn as the "immortal, invisible, God only wise, in light inaccessible hid from our eyes," is dropping to one's knees and averting one's eyes, knowing that none can see God face to face and live.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>There is nothing inherently wrong with this, of course, and it is quite a natural response to the God who is the Lord of the universe, Ruler of creation, King of kings, and so on—to use the imagery that has dominated the Christian tradition through the centuries. However, it should be clear that the relationship one has with such a God has its constraints, as it presupposes a certain distance, a certain respect, and a certain level of intimidation that precludes the possibility of intimacy. Incidentally, this is thought to be one reason why the Virgin Mary in particular and the saints in general have been so popular historically in the Catholic tradition—they are seen as more approachable, easier to relate to, and more sympathetic than either God the Father or Jesus Christ.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>Juxtapose the image of a divine ruler, sitting enthroned in heaven, with a very different one: the baby Krishna, crawling around on all fours, stealing butter and teasing his mother and the other cowherd women. Obviously, the relationship Krishna inspires in those around him, particularly in the relationship he has with his mother, Yashoda, and his gopi lovers, is also very different. The intimacy here offers a very special sort of divine invitation: in Krishna's youthful exploits, the faithful see how "God, revealing himself as an infant, invites man [sic] to dispense with formality and undue respect and come to him openly, delighting in him intimately."</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">6.</span>Since we have no stories of Jesus' young childhood, it is impossible to know anything of the day-to-day relationship that his parents, and Mary in particular, had with him. Did she ever spank him? Put him in a "time-out"? Was he rebellious? The brief mention the Bible makes of Mary's explicit contemplation of her young son emphasizes the mystery and wonder with which she considers him. Both after the shepherds visit Jesus in the manger and after she and Joseph find the twelve-year-old in the temple in Jerusalem, Luke records that Mary "treasured" the words that were spoken about him, and kept them close in her heart. Beyond that, the Bible is silent.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">7.</span>By contrast, as was demonstrated in chapter 2, the Hindu scriptures are full of stories about Yashoda and Krishna, detailing the many ways he drove her to distraction, causing chaos not only in her household but in the households of others as well. In these stories Krishna seems no more than an ordinary little boy at play who encourages his mother, his cowherd friends, and the other women to respond to him accordingly. The tradition is clear, however, that this intimate, informal, up-close and personal relationship Krishna fosters is very intentionally and carefully managed by him, through the power of his yogamaya, or illusion.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">8.</span>It is instructive to revisit the story of the theophany of Krishna's universal form. Yashoda holds Krishna in her arms, scolding him because she has been told that Krishna was eating mud. He protests his innocence, and tells her she should look into his mouth for proof, and when she does, she sees the whole universe therein. She is completely bewildered and shocked, and the text says that she immediately offers homage to him as the omnipotent, supreme Lord. However, Krishna does not desire such awe-inspired veneration from Yashoda, and so the story concludes by telling how Krishna "cast his yogamaya" over his mother, erasing the memory of what she has just seen, and filling her heart with intense love and maternal affection. In this way, over and over, he appears and acts as a regular young boy— lifting the mask only when and where he chooses and quickly pulling it back down again in order to facilitate intimate relationships with his devotees. Steven Rosen explains it this way:</p>
                         <blockquote>
                             <p>After all, awareness of Krishna's Lordship evokes a sense of majesty and subservience before the Supreme. To enable his devotees to rise beyond this stage, with the ability to engage in intimate, loving exchange with him, he masks his divinity. Imagine the gopis getting angry at Krishna for stealing their yogurt and butter if they were aware of his supreme position in the cosmic scheme of things. Or consider mother Yashoda: Would she bother to chase after him or enjoy motherly affection if she were conscious that he is God?<sup>23</sup></p>
                         </blockquote>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">9.</span>The kind of easy intimacy with and uninhibited love for Krishna that Yashoda and others are able to experience is believed by those who worship him to be superior to a relationship that consists primarily of philosophical reflection or dutiful worship. Thus, for devotees of Krishna through the succeeding centuries, this unique type of relationship that both Yashoda and the gopis have with Krishna is held as the highest standard and the goal for all Krishna's followers. Seen in this light, "Krishna's 'mischief' is far from ordinary. His life as an impetuous young boy is a gift to his devotees . . . Rather than evoking consternation, his rowdy pastimes ultimately serve a purifying function, healing and giving joy to all who take part in them. In short, these stories enable devotees to transcend the distance created by awe and reverence and situate them in a loving mood of divine intimacy."</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">10.</span>There is a lesson in all this for contemporary Hindus, as it points to the soteriological value of finding joy with God in the everyday activities of daily life, and meeting God just as one is, in the midst of mundane tasks and obligations. No extraordinary measures need to be taken; no special skills need to be developed. One need not leave one's home behind and go to the church or temple to seek God; instead, God is readily present while one is cooking dinner, or caring for children, or tending the garden.</p>
                         <blockquote>
                            <p>The story of Yashoda is charming, and it is also relevant for us. We need to respect the heroic quests which often characterize the path to spiritual wisdom, the great confrontations with life and death. But it would be a mistake to confine wisdom to heroic circumstances. Yashoda's example suggests that we do not need the extraordinary and the exotic; ordinary religious practice, persevering love in ordinary duties and relationships, can be the vehicle of divine presence and provide the opportunity for unexpected encounters with God. Life itself is infused with divine presence; the details of ordinary life can become the occasion for moments of vision.<sup>25</sup></p>
                         </blockquote>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">11.</span>There may well be an infinite distance separating humanity from God, but in his infancy and youth, Krishna shows himself ready and eager to fully bridge it, inviting his devotees into a relationship characterized by simplicity, familial affection, and personal intimacy. For this reason, like no other divine figure in Hinduism, "[Krishna] most perfectly exemplifies the divine nearness, rare embodiment, extraordinary loveliness, and most astonishing acts of divine tenderness."<sup>26</sup> Unsurprisingly, then, as we have seen, in response to Krishna's activity in the world, he inspires the most tender expressions of love in his devotees. Let me conclude this section with an extended quote from Diana Eck, describing a store in India dedicated to the child Krishna:</p>
                         <blockquote>
                             <p>In Vishvanath Gali, the most crowded of Banaras commercial lanes, there is one store that sells nothing but clothing and adornments for the child Krishna. It opens into the lane like a cupboard stocked with dazzling piles of color: blue, pink, and gold satin outfits, trimmed with silvery ribbon; tiny ornaments and necklaces; crowns and headdresses, tiny peacock feathers to top off the crowns; little silver flutes; little enameled eyes to add to an image at the time it is installed on the home altar. Visiting that shop with a friend and trying the little outfits on the brass image of the crawling Krishna, I had to admit that there is something in all of us that loves this sort of thing. There is a lightness and playfulness to it that is consonant with the spirit of Krishna devotion. No one imagines for a moment that Krishna needs the little blue satin outfit we have just slipped on around his arms or the tiny strand of beads we have put around his neck. Indeed, no one imagines that the world-spanning Krishna is confined to this little brass image at all. This acting out, this "playing house," has to do with us and the ability to bring our affections and sensibilities to the service of God.<sup>27</sup></p>
                         </blockquote>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">12.</span>It is this last point Eck makes—Krishna's līlā facilitating our "ability to bring our affections and sensibilities to the service of God"— that will be examined in the next section, which explores the soteriological efficacy of this loving relationship between Krishna and his devotees.</p>

                     <h4>5. Saved in Relationship: Loving Devotion to Krishna</h4>
                     <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>In World Religions Today, a popular college textbook, Hinduism is characterized with the phrase "myriad paths to salvation."<sup>28</sup> While chapter 2 here provides a taste of the diversity Hinduism contains, describing with any brevity the vast multiplicity of beliefs and practices that it encompasses would be impossible. However, when it comes to "paths to salvation," there are three particular "forms of Hindu religiosity" that dominate. The first, called karma-marga or karma-yoga, represents the path of duty and sacrifice; the second, jñāna-marga or jñāna-yoga, represents the path of knowledge; and the third, bhakti-marga or bhakti-yoga, represents the path of devotional participation.<sup>29</sup> One path is not necessarily better than another—although practitioners within each camp might argue the superior virtues of their chosen path over and against the others. Instead, the particular way in which one chooses to live out one’s faith often is determined by family, social status, personal disposition, and geographical location. The path that concerns us here is the third path, called bhakti, which encompasses the relationship of love and devotion that one cultivates with a specific deity.</p>
                     <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>The bhakti movement, which originated in South India, dates back to roughly the seventh century. A vast literature of songs and poetry written in vernacular languages developed along with this movement. In particular, the writings of the twelve poets called alvars, who lived between the sixth and tenth centuries CE and were believed to be deeply and fully devoted to Vishnu, are given pride of place in bhakti literature. They, along with the Bhagavata Purana, epitomize the true nature of the movement.<sup>30</sup> Thomas Hopkins writes that "in the Bhagavata, as for the Alvars, [bhakti] is a passionate devotion of one's whole self in complete surrender to the Lord, a total way of life that is not one way among many but the only way to true salvation."<sup>31</sup> Exclusive devotion to Krishna, however, really developed from the eleventh century onward, with such poems as the Gita Govinda, written by Jayadeva in the twelfth century and celebrating Krishna as the cowherd lover.<sup>32</sup> Since then, bhakti movements dedicated to Krishna have been a strong presence in the Hindu landscape and have spread into all of India and beyond.</p>
                     <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>What is probably still the most well-known Hindu tradition in North America is the "Hare Krishna" movement, or ISKON (International Society for Krisha Consciousness). This bhakti movement was launched by Swami Bhaktivedanta in New York City in 1965. Bhaktivedanta, who became a Krishna devotee in India, was challenged early on by his guru to "preach Krishna throughout the world." When he was sixty-nine, he finally got the opportunity to come to America, where he found a welcome in the hippie culture of the 1960s. Basically, he taught that chanting the god's name makes God present, and infuses the chanter with the bliss that is god's nature. In the United States, ISKON has lost much of its following, but in India it is still a growing religious presence.</p>
                     <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>Turning back to India, it is important to realize how strong a role the bhakti movements continue to play in contemporary Hinduism. Axel Michaels writes that "Devotionalism is currently the most popular form of religiosity in India,"<sup>33</sup> and there are good reasons for this. To be a bhakta, one does not have to have any particular level of education or special intellectual abilities, nor does one need to speak and/or read Sanskrit. One does not need to be a member of a certain caste, with certain privileges, nor does one need to have a certain level of wealth. This path is also freely open to women. In other words, anyone, in any condition of life, can live out the practice of devoting oneself in faithfulness and love to God—in fact, historically, tradition held that lower-caste Hindus, because of their "natural disposition" to service, are ideal candidates for this path, and actually are better bhaktis than high-caste Brahmins.<sup>34</sup></p>
                     <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>Bhakti, then, is an equal-opportunity path and, in addition, it is a path with a high degree of emotional appeal, as it puts the believer in an intimate, personal relationship with a god who returns all the love she or he is given a hundredfold. Michaels writes that</p>
                     <blockquote>
                         <p>The Bhakti notion of God is extremely anthropomorphic and personal... the believers see themselves as the children of the god or as his servants (dasa)... The idea of god as a savior and redeemer, of the savior and "Descender" (avatara), who seeks the proximity of men [sic] to support them in their need, is also closely connected with Bhakti movements. On the other hand, the image of the united lovers, for whom there is no longer a painful, yearning separation, is a favorite metaphor for a successful or desired encounter with God.<sup>35</sup></p>
                     </blockquote>
                     <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">6.</span>The gods most associated with the bhakti path are Shiva and Vishnu. As an avatar of Vishnu, Krishna is obviously included here as well. However, it is fair to say that because of who Krishna is and the kind of life he lived while on earth—especially the way he lived as an infant and young boy—Krishna is the deity above all who inspires devotees to follow the bhakti path. Indeed, one definition of bhakti says that "Bhakti is selfless dedication to the Bhagavat [supreme Lord], the svarupa [true form or essence] of which is Krishna."<sup>36</sup></p>
                     <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">7.</span>Some of the most fervent disciples of this path, including some of the most famous poets and songwriters, have favored Krishna with their love and devotion, even those who still consider themselves Vaishnavites. For example, the Vaishnava theologian Bhaktivinoda Thakur writes that "Krishna, among all manifestations of Vishnu, is an ocean of intimacy, and one can derive the highest bliss by becoming reestablished in one's eternal relationship with him, which is now dormant." He goes on to define the bhakti path this way:</p>
                     <blockquote>
                         <p>"Devotional service" (Bhakti-yoga) is the mystical path by which one can enter into a relationship with God—it supersedes all pious action, the cultivation of knowledge, and various mystical endeavors, such as yoga and meditation (though in its practice it subsumes various forms of yogic mysticism). The science of this holy devotion is detailed in books such as the Bhagavad-Gita and the Bhagavata-Purana, but it is chiefly understood by associating with devotees who carry it in their hearts. The central practices of this path include singing the praises of God, chanting his names in regulated fashion, offering food to him as a sacrament of devotion, and worshiping his image in the temple or in one's home. Pure love of God is alone the ultimate fruit of the spiritual journey.<sup>37</sup></p>
                     </blockquote>
                     <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">8.</span>Three characteristics of the bhakti path have special relevance to Krishna and his devotees: love, joy, and physicality.</p>

                    <section id="ch3-sec5-18">
                        <h5>18. Love and Eros</h5>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>Far and away the most important aspect of the bhakti path is love—the love one feels for God, the deeply loving relationship one cultivates with God, and the love god returns to the disciple. For those on the bhakti path, this disposition and experience of love far outweigh any other type of relationship one might cultivate with the Divine, and Krishna, more than any other Hindu deity, embodies this passionate love: "Krishnaite Vaishnavas draw on the fact that Krishna is the embodiment of intimacy and love, qualities that, among all others, stand supreme."<sup>38</sup> There is no need to rehearse all the ways in which Krishna manifests love in the course of his young life; in particular, the love was embodied in Krishna's relationship with his mother and with the gopis.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>What is particularly important to emphasize here, however, is the erotic quality of that love—and this certainly needs some explanation for Christian ears. Christians are used to a threefold distinction when it comes to love: eros, which refers to the kind of love partners and spouses have for each other and from which we get the word erotic (which leads to some unfortunate, and not entirely accurate, caricatures); philia, which refers to the kind of love we have for friends; and agape, referring to the kind of love that God has for God's people. Agape is not motivated by what one can get for oneself, but is instead moved by care and concern for the well-being of the other. It is this kind of love to which Christians have traditionally seen themselves called, and to which Christians have aspired, because it calls forth a response of charity, grace, and kindness toward poor and rich, weak and strong, friend and foe alike. It does not seek its own satisfaction, but only the good of the other. There is nothing inherently wrong with this focus on agape love, except that, over the course of time, the other two types of love, and particularly eros, were dramatically downplayed and even demonized in the church, so that agape became synonymous with the highest expression of Christian love, and every other form of love was seen as something less, something outside the church, and again, even something sinful.<sup>39</sup></p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>With Krishna, however, love is understood quite differently, and the erotic component of love is front and center. As we saw in Krishna's dance with the gopis, his physical passion and their amorous attentions toward him are a key part of the divine experience of love—and Krishna intentionally courts this physical, sexual response from the young women. In the bhakti tradition, the physical desire of the gopis for Krishna is a manifestation of the depth of their love for him, and it is this desire that later generations of devotees have sought to replicate. Indeed, this erotic love is even argued to be the highest form of love one can experience: "To be an intimate associate of God, particularly one with the intensity of love exhibited by the gopis, is the highest possible perfection of human existence in the Bhagavata."<sup>40</sup></p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>It should be noted that this type of love is not unknown to Christianity. In fact, the medieval mystics drew heavily upon the biblical imagery of bride and bridegroom as well as the language of ecstasy to describe their own profound, intimate experiences of union with Christ. Indeed, both male and female mystics described being penetrated by the arrows of God's love, ravished by Christ, and physically transported by divine rapture that left one weak, trembling, and feeling "inebriated"—sometimes for days. One needs only call to mind the image of Bernini's famous sculpture, "The Ecstasy of Saint Teresa," to remember the place such ecstatic—yes, even erotic—love has held in at least some expressions of Christianity.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>This kind of rapture that Krishna invites points to the fact that such physical experiences of love are an integral part of the salvific relationship the devotee has with Krishna. It also points to the body as being a locus of salvation. In the bhakti relationship, the body is capable of receiving divine love, of expressing love for the Divine, and, indeed, the body is the place above all where the loving relationship with the Divine is experienced. Unlike the typical negative stereotype of sexual desire and physical affection, so prevalent in Christianity, that conflates love and lust, desire and domination, enjoyment and exploitation, Krishna invites his devotees into a deeply moving physical relationship that captivates all their senses and moves them at every level, inviting a full-body reply: "Krishna moves in a realm of love and lovemaking that invites (indeed, demands) a total, impassioned response. All those who enter this realm are freed from bondage to the ordinary and customary, freed to behave imaginatively and spontaneously. The erotic aspect of this other world is not degrading but life-affirming."<sup>41</sup></p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">6.</span>This affirmation of the body and of the role of physical desire in the saving relationship one has with the Divine relates to another important theological and soteriological issue on which bhaktis express strong opinions. Arguing against those who would maintain that God cannot have a form, or that it is somehow higher or better—more spiritually advanced, if you will—to relate to a God without specific characteristics, Vaishnava philosophy posits that "if loving exchange is the highest activity, as most will admit, then God would most definitely deign to be a person—for loving exchange loses meaning without personhood; it can only exist between people."<sup>42</sup></p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">7.</span>Note what is being argued here: love, which is unquestionably the highest expression of devotion and the most important aspect of the human-divine relationship, cannot truly exist without two partners— two players who can willfully and joyfully develop a connection that is personal, particular, and expressed and experienced in the material world. For bhaktis, the love of an abstract, transpersonal entity—even a divine entity—is decidedly inferior (and not really love at all). So, too, is the idea that the lover and the beloved are the same—the idea that while there appear to be two in an I/Thou relationship, in reality, there is only the divine I, and everything apart from the Divine is an illusion. Both of these two options for understanding and interpreting the divine/human relationship are thoroughly rejected by bhaktis:</p>
                         <blockquote>
                             <p>To describe the absolute as merely nirvishesha, or without quality and attributes, is to make Him imperfect by amputating, as it were, the auspicious limbs of His divine personality. Once the absolute, complete, and perfect nature of the Divine Being is recognized, the philosophy of impersonalism cannot consistently be maintained. The Bhagavad Gita clearly describes the Absolute as both personal and impersonal, or rather as possessing infinite attributes and forms, including an impersonal dimension. When this is properly understood, the conflicting statements of the Vedas and the Puranas can easily be reconciled. But according to the primary and general sense of the scriptures, the Absolute is essentially personal, because only in a personal Absolute, possessing infinite and inconceivable potencies, can the manifest forms of Godhead, including the impersonal Brahman, have their place. In fact, complete monism, or Advaita Vedanta, would inadvertently obliterate the entire spiritual quest as we know it—for how can one worship oneself? On a practical level, it is simply not possible, leading to frustration and the abandonment of spirituality in general. But more to the point is this: If one is, in the ultimate sense, God, there is no need for submission to a superior spirit. There is no I and Thou, no relationship and no love.<sup>43</sup></p>
                         </blockquote>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">8.</span>One certainly can say that in Hinduism, Krishna, more than any other god or goddess, creates, facilitates, and nurtures the I-Thou relationship with each and every one of his devotees, filling them with desire and bestowing upon them his abundant love. Two central aspects of this relationship, joy and physicality, which are reflections of this key characteristic of love, need also be briefly mentioned here.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="ch3-sec5-19">
                        <h5>19. Joy</h5>
                        <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>Intimately related to the experience of love is the experience of joy. The love Krishna himself displays, and the love he calls forth from his devotees, is not the grave sort that demands austerity, somber reflection, or physical deprivation. Instead, as we have seen over and over in Krishna's biography, Krishna's kind of love is better described as reckless abandon, giddy excitement, and spontaneous outbursts of sheer glee. Krishna clearly takes delight in his playfulness, and he inspires delight in others, even as he exasperates them with his willfulness. It is clear, then, that a central part of what it means to be a devotee of Krishna is rejoicing in him, giving oneself over to the happiness of reading about him, thinking about him, and listening to the stories of his life. In short, a relationship with Krishna demands that one allow oneself to be carried away by the spirit of pleasure and play that permeates the whole of Krishna's young life.</p>
                        <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>It is this shared joyous play with the Divine, more than obedience, more than adoration, more than exultation, that characterizes the saving relationship a devotee has with Krishna: "According to the Bhagavata (10.47.58), to be an intimate associate of God able to play with him by participating in this līlā is the highest possible perfection of human existence."<sup>44</sup> For it is in this shared play that the Divine and the human are joined in a union of absolute bliss—sheer joy and delight. All constraint is removed, all the boundaries that would separate God from humanity are bridged, and humanity's own inherent playful nature is set free to join with the Divine. As David Kinsley writes:</p>
                        <blockquote>
                            <p>Bhakti, like play, is nonutilitarian, transcending the barriers of pragmatic existence . . . It is superfluous activity that is undertaken as an end in itself... Like play, it is also joyous, jubilant, and often merry, particularly when it is directed toward Krishna. Bhakti, then, seems to illustrate the fact that in his relationship to God man’s nature as a player comes to the fore... Or at least the implication is that the appropriate meeting ground [between God and humanity] is one of freedom and joy, where man is not bound by habit and necessity but is free to behave spontaneously.<sup>45</sup></p>

                    <section id="ch3-sec5-20">
                         <h5>20. Physicality</h5>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>Finally, it is important to note one of the key aspects of the Krishna/devotee relationship discussed above, and that is its corporeal character.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>Francis Clooney offers the following description of Krishna: "When Hindus think of Krishna, they are thinking of a God who speaks to the human heart in a language we can understand, a God who appears with a face we can see. As the theologian Ramanuja put it in the eleventh century, Krishna is God—Lord Vishnu, Narayana—come down to this earth so that people can see and hear and touch God."<sup>46</sup> It is this seeing, this hearing, and, particularly, this touching that makes one's relationship to Krishna so powerful. There is a visceral character to this relationship that emphasizes its here-and-now aspect: one does not have to wait until death to experience Krishna's love and grace, nor does one have to reach a certain state of spiritual refinement or maturity. And, most certainly, one does not need to forget her body, deny her body, or be indifferent to her body to enter into relationship with Krishna. Instead, Krishna comes to his devotees right in the midst of their physical lives—their manual labors—right in the middle of their sweat, blood, and tears, incorporating all of it into the bond he creates with them. This is how he formed relationships when he was on earth, and this is how he continues to form relationships even now.</p>
                         <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>Contemporary devotees, then, look back to the gopis and to Yashoda herself to see how Krishna comes to those who worship him in the midst of their daily lives. This is one reason for the emphasis on telling and re-telling the stories of Krishna's infancy and youth and on the importance of imagining oneself as taking part in those stories. Imaginative play serves to make Krishna real for those who love him and make their experience of him more vivid:</p>
                         <blockquote>
                             <p>Traditionally, the deeds of the cowherd women are meant to be imitated by others, even those who have never actually seen Krishna. God can be approached and experienced if we remember, imagine, and allow ourselves to become actors in the drama of God's work on earth; as they play their parts devotees find, to their surprise and delight, that God comes and interacts with them too, in ways old and new. Such acts of remembering and imagining are very powerful, for they make it possible to experience anew God's mighty deeds from the past.<sup>47</sup></p>
                         </blockquote>

                <section id="ch3-sec6">
                    <h4>6. The True Nature of Reality<sup>48</sup></h4>
                    <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>The most explicit aspect of Krishna’s soteriological efficacy is what he teaches regarding the true nature of reality. This requires a brief explanation of a Hindu worldview. Like those in many Eastern religions, Hindus believe in reincarnation. That is, they believe that every soul goes through the cycle of birth, death, and rebirth (samsara) until that soul is released—which is called moksha or liberation—typically through right understanding, that is, the knowledge that the individual does not have permanent, enduring, discrete existence. Once this knowledge is achieved, upon death the person is completely obliterated—"de-individualized," if you will, and becomes one with the Absolute, ending the life cycle of that soul. In the meantime, however, one's karma determines one's rebirth: good karma produces good effects that are realized in one's next birth into a higher caste, for example; bad karma produces bad effects resulting in a lower birth as an animal, for example. This is a bare-bones description, of course, and Hindu belief and practice include many modifications and variations of these basic views.</p>
                    <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>Bhaktis comprise one such group that has adopted some variants in this soteriological schema. Bhaktis believe that God's grace ameliorates one's karma, and because God is all-powerful, God can at any time grant liberation to any person. Thus, bhaktis relate to God as their redeemer and savior, and they believe that the most important religious practice one can perform is wholehearted devotion and submission to God. This devotion results in liberation from the mundane world even in this life and guarantees that the individual will be able to continue his or her devotion after death: "The inner life of such a soul, then, allows one to be engaged in worldly affairs and, simultaneously, to be detached from such affairs, due to one's absorption in devotional love. . . For the devoted soul, death is conquered within this life through deep absorption in the beloved object."<sup>49</sup></p>
                    <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">3.</span>Not surprisingly, the end that is envisioned here is not perfect absorption into some impersonal Ultimate, but rather a kind of non-dualistic union with God that is eternal. In the case of Krishna, this often is envisioned as the everlasting joy of delighting in Krishna's presence and worshiping his "lotus feet" in his heavenly abode for eternity. In this view, if one speaks about "losing oneself," it is meant to carry more of a metaphorical connotation: "If there is any loss of the individualized self, it is not an ontological or metaphysical one, but a forgetfulness of one's own self through complete blissful absorption in meditation on God. . . the highest goal of life for the Bhagavata is to reside as an eternal individual in an eternal divine abode, rendering loving devotion to an eternal personal supreme being, Vishnu/ Krishna."<sup>50</sup></p>
                    <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">4.</span>For his devotees, this is the end for which Krishna has come into the world, and thus his every move is geared toward their salvation as he pours on them grace upon grace in order to persuade them to give themselves over into his capable hands.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                         <p>[Krishna's] appearance in the world is seen as grace, pure and simple, a magic show, of sorts, performed for our benefit. In other words, his life in the material world has a soteriological function in that it is meant to cure us of our spiritual amnesia, reminding us of our real life in the spiritual realm—encouraging us to go back home, back to Godhead. His eternal pastimes are, ultimately, imported from the spiritual world, and he sometimes manifests them here, just to entice us.<sup>51</sup></p>
                     </blockquote>
                    <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">5.</span>This is Krishna's whole reason for being, according to the Bhagavata Purana:</p>
                    <blockquote>
                         <p>Krishna is no longer regarded as having been born solely to kill a tyrant and rid the world of demons [an interpretation that we find in the Bhagavad Gita, for example]. His chief function now is to vindicate passion as the symbol of final union with God . . . The function of the new Krishna was to defend these two premises—that romantic love was the most exalted experience in life and secondly, that of all the roads to salvation, the impassioned adoration of God was the one most valid. God must be adored.<sup>52</sup></p>
                     </blockquote>
                    <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">6.</span>Krishna's particular playful character and loving, mischievous activities are one of the central ways in which he fulfills this function, drawing his devotees out of their preoccupation with transitory worldly matters into absolute devotion to himself. Through Krishna's irresistible attraction, beauty, and charm, he is able "to attract the souls lost in samsara [delusion and suffering] to the beauty of līlā with God, and thus entice them to relinquish their attachment to the self-centered indulgences of this world of samsara, which simply perpetuate the cycle of karma, and thus of repeated birth and death."<sup>53</sup></p>
                    <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">7.</span>As might be imagined, given his surpassing popularity and his delightful character, Krishna has inspired a huge canon of devotional hymns and poetry in a wide variety of vernacular languages across the Indian subcontinent. One of the most important and well-known is the Tiruvaymoli, a central devotional poem for the Sri Vaishnava community in South India, written by the ninth-century poet Sathakopan (affectionately known as "Namalvar"). In this poem, he writes about "the salvific nature of thinking about Krishna's mischief" in the following words: "Leaving aside many kinds of knowledge that hit the mark, and penances performed over many ages, in this very birth, in a few days, I've attained their results, my heart follows my Lord who hid and ate in stealth the butter and milk in the hanging pot, ending the sorrows of being born."</p>
                    <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">8.</span>This poem points to one of the key beliefs of the bhaktis: devotion, particularly devotion to Krishna, is the superior soteriological aim, accomplishing in "a few days" what philosophical speculation, empty ritual, sacrifice, and physical austerities cannot accomplish in many lifetimes. This is also reflected in the Bhagavata Purana, where it is clear that those who relate to Krishna in love, yearning for a personal relationship with him, have a higher understanding of God than the yogis who have come to a more philosophical, de-personalized understanding of God.</p>
                    <blockquote>
                         <p>The most significant incidents in Krishna's life are not the awe-inspiring demonstrations of power, but precisely the opposite. It is the quieter moments which strike a chord in the hearts of spiritual aspirants. Not so much what He does but what He is makes the difference. His gentleness, His playfulness, His sweetness and affection, His tender concerns for everyone, His bewitching smile, melting eyes and graceful movements, His genius and humor, everything together amounts to a Being ultimately worshipable as the Absolute Truth and yet infinitely lovable and approachable. His irresistible physical beauty and mesmerizing charm are far more indicative of His divinity than supernatural deeds because these are what grip the hearts of devotees and, in mystics, inspire ecstasy, samadhi and, eventually, God-realization.<sup>55</sup></p>
                     </blockquote>
                    <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">9.</span>Devotion to Krishna is an unquestionably soteriological action— one that, by all accounts, is richly rewarding to all who undertake it.</p>

                    <h4>7. Conclusion</h4>
                    <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">1.</span>Chapters 2 and 3 have introduced the reader to Krishna and also explained the soteriological significance of his infancy and youth. It should be clear that because an all-encompassing relationship of love with Krishna is viewed by his devotees as the superior path to salvation, the stories in which he is most approachable, most accessible, and most charming and attractive are of particular significance. It is during Krishna's boyhood, as in no other stage in his life, when Krishna is most willing and able to facilitate the type of relationship that is seen as salvific. Thus, it is that special relationship that Krishna had with his mother Yashoda and the gopis in particular that contemporary devotees most try to participate in and emulate in the course of their own daily lives. They do this by means of joyous celebration of Krishna in song and dance, single-minded meditation on his person and his actions, and recitation and reading of the stories of his life, particularly those of his youth. In all this, Krishna’s devotees hope to receive his grace and the blessing of liberation both in this life and in eternity.</p>
                    <p class="numbered-paragraph"><span class="paragraph-number">2.</span>From this analysis of Krishna, then, Part 2 turns to Jesus Christ. Paralleling the methodology used in these two chapters, we will examine similar questions from the perspective of the Christian tradition.</p>
