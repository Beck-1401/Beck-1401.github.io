        <h1>College Class Report: Hinduism and Philosophy Review Game</h1>

        <h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
            This class session began with a brief meditation led by Brad. The main activity was a team-based review game, formatted similarly to Jeopardy, covering concepts from Hinduism and related philosophical ideas. Brad explained the rules: teams would choose categories, answer questions within a time limit, and could steal points if the initial team failed. Topics included Greek philosophical terms, details about Krishna (his mother Yashoda, the Rāslīlā dance, his love for butter, subduing Kaliya), Mahāvākyas (Great Sayings) from the Upaniṣads, the Ṣaḍ Darśanas (six orthodox schools of Hindu philosophy like Nyāya, Vaiśeṣika, Mīmāṃsā), key figures and texts (Durgā, Sītā, Rāvaṇa, Rāmāyaṇam, Purāṇas, Upaniṣads), and concepts like Brahman and Jñāna Mārga. Team 13 emerged as the winner. As a fun conclusion, Brad performed some TikTok/Fortnite dances and a short rap for the class. The session ended with logistical discussions regarding office hours and a podcast assignment due after spring break.

            <p><span class="timestamp">[01:04]</span> <strong>Brad:</strong> Let's take one breath together. Go ahead and breathe in.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[01:09]</span> <strong>Brad:</strong> And let it all out.</p>

            <h2 id="game_rules">Explanation of Review Game Rules</h2>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[01:14]</span> <strong>Brad:</strong> Word. So, today we're doing a little bit of Līlā, having a play, play day. And yeah. So, I think the best way to do it is maybe kind of what we did in the previous class was we'll just go, we'll go in team order, start with 11 and go up through 18, and then we'll reverse and go 18 back to 11 and just kind of do back and forth like that. And so when it's your turn, when it's your team's turn, you can pick any category. We got to put away all notes and screens and everything. So no no notes or anything. It's just review. It's also just for fun.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[02:03]</span> <strong>Brad:</strong> So when it's your turn, when it's your team's turn, you can pick a category. They're kind of a little bit from easiest to hardest, but not really. And so they're really just going to all be one point. So everything's one point.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[02:21]</span> <strong>Brad:</strong> And if you, if your team, we'll give you like 30 seconds or so. You know. But if your team can't come up with the answer in 30 seconds, then we'll go with whoever's hands up. And if there's multiple hands up, then I'll roll a D8.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[02:40]</span> <strong>Brad:</strong> Unless there's two, huh?</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[02:42]</span> <strong>Student 2:</strong> A D8?</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[02:43]</span> <strong>Brad:</strong> D8?</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[02:44]</span> <strong>Student 2:</strong> D8? Not a gamer?</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[02:46]</span> <strong>Brad:</strong> A D8, yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[02:48]</span> <strong>Student 2:</strong> Clearly not.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[02:50]</span> <strong>Brad:</strong> D8. But, I don't know. If there's only two people, then we'll do we'll do rock paper scissors.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[03:04]</span> <strong>Brad:</strong> The winner, I'm open to I'm open to suggestions, but the plan was winning team gets to choose a, you know, Tik Tok dance or Fortnite dance or something for me to do. Or I do also have just doing Fortnite dance.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[03:26]</span> <strong>Student 3:</strong> Is there a final jeopardy Brad?</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[03:30]</span> <strong>Brad:</strong> Huh? Regular teams, your regular teams.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[03:34]</span> <strong>Student 4:</strong> Wait, do you actually have...</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[03:37]</span> <strong>Brad:</strong> So you only have three people, it's okay. In the last class, the winning team only had three members. So, you know.</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[03:45]</span> <strong>Student 3:</strong> Brad, is there a final jeopardy?</p>
            <p><span class="timestamp">[03:46]</span> <strong>Brad:</strong> There's not.</p>
