Here's a detailed description of the image, including the OCR results and language identification:

**Overall Description:**

The image shows a set of two blackboards joined together, possibly in a classroom or educational setting. The boards are covered with handwritten notes, diagrams, and keywords in white chalk. The writing appears to be related to philosophy and potentially metaphysics, as evidenced by terms like "Energy," "Matter," "Ontology," and "Dualism." The boards are framed and mounted on a wall.
