        <h1>Comparative Theology: Hindu Traditions - Class Summary</h1>

        <h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
        <p>This class session began with a brief centering meditation. Following this, Brad discussed administrative matters, confirming with the class their preference to replace the final exam with a third podcast assignment, which was met with enthusiasm. The core of the lecture involved a detailed review of foundational concepts within Hindu traditions, presented initially as a study guide review. Key topics included the four *Purusharthas* (aims of life), the four *Ashramas* (stages of life), the four *Varnas* (societal divisions based on vocation), the four categories of sacred texts (*Shruti*, *Smriti*, *Itihasa*, *Purana*), the divisions within the Vedas, the *Trimarga* (three paths to liberation), the major divisions of *Bhakti* (*Shakta*, *Shaiva*, *Vaishnava*), the distinction between *Astika* (orthodox, Veda-accepting) and *Nastika* (non-orthodox) schools, and a brief overview of the *Shad Darshana* (six orthodox philosophical systems). Brad emphasized the importance of understanding these frameworks to grasp the context for deeper study, particularly for the upcoming comparison of the Bhagavad Gita and the Gospel of John. The session concluded with an introduction to Krishna as an *avatara* of Vishnu, explaining the concept of *avatara* (divine descent) and briefly outlining the ten primary avatars. A story from the Bhagavata *Purana* about the child Krishna (*Bala Krishna*) revealing the universe in his mouth to his mother Yashoda was shared via video and discussed, highlighting themes of divine play (*lila*) and relationship over worship.</p>

        <h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Understanding the foundational frameworks (Purusharthas, Ashramas, Varnas, Textual Categories, Darshanas) is crucial for contextualizing specific Hindu theological concepts and texts.</li>
            <li>Hindu traditions encompass diverse paths (*margas*) to liberation (*moksha*), including action (*karma*), knowledge (*jnana*), and devotion (*bhakti*).</li>
            <li>The distinction between *Shruti* (revealed, heard texts like the Vedas) and *Smriti* (remembered texts like epics and Puranas) is fundamental to understanding textual authority.</li>
            <li>The *Shad Darshana* represent six orthodox philosophical viewpoints that accept the authority of the Vedas but interpret reality and the path to liberation differently.</li>
            <li>The concept of *Avatara* signifies a divine descent (like Krishna as an avatar of Vishnu), which differs theologically from concepts like incarnation in other traditions. Avatars are understood as fully divine, appearing in form but not limited by it.</li>
            <li>Stories (*Puranas*) about deities like Krishna often illustrate complex theological ideas through narrative, emphasizing aspects like divine play (*lila*), the accessibility of the divine, and the importance of relationship.</li>
            <li>Different devotional traditions (*Bhakti*) focus on specific forms of the divine (e.g., Shakti, Shiva, Vishnu/Krishna), each with rich theological and narrative traditions.</li>

            <h3 id="section-6:48">Review of Foundational Concepts (Study Guide)</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[6:48-7:03]</span> I did create this study guide for the exam. It's not comprehensive by any means at all. But I want to review it together.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[7:04-7:09]</span> These are still, I think very important things for you to have the proper amount of context to really understand,</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[7:12-7:20]</span> you know, Hindu theology, Hindu traditions is enormous, right? So incredibly enormous.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[7:20-7:36]</span> We are studying a teeny tiny little part of it. I'm not trying to give you an overview of the whole thing.

            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[7:36-7:47]</span> But I want you to understand how those smaller parts that we're diving deep into fit into the larger context of this thing that we refer to as Hindu theology.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[7:47-8:14]</span> So, to that end, let's go over some of these things. I think what we'll do is I'll give you some more in addition to this, but over the next half, the second half of the semester, we'll just have some more quizzes to kind of, you know, get you to, right, want this, want this stuff to be kind of up here, right?</p>

            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[9:06-9:25]</span> I'm just really off today. I'm just totally off today. The whole first class I was crazy nervous. I broke Boston College. Like I'm nervous now about that. I just broke it. Like broke it.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[9:25-9:29]</span> Anyway,</p>

            <h3 id="section-9:29">The Four Purusharthas (Aims of Life)</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[9:29-9:35]</span> Four *Purusharthas*. So there are lots of fours in here. So let's tackle the first one.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[9:35-9:45]</span> *Purusha*, *Purusha*, you know, means person. And *Artha*, in this case means, oh, before I start, let me start over.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[9:46-9:51]</span> What's wrong with me today, Drew? I don't know if it's, Drew's making me nervous.</p>

            <h3 id="section-9:51">Etymology Digression: Atmosphere & Atman</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[9:51-10:01]</span> So Vanya brought up this etymology of atmosphere. And so I did a deep dive into that. And so the,</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[10:02-10:35]</span> the word atmosphere comes from the Greek *Atmos*. Can't even remember how to draw an alpha. How do you draw an alpha? Yeah, right? That's what I was going to do, but I was like, that's a G, but that's a G. Yeah, so *Atmos* (<span class="original-script">ἀτμός</span>), which means vapor, water vapor,</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[10:35-10:59]</span> But, obviously, obviously, I think as you're pointing out, connected in some way to this *Atman* (<span class="original-script">आत्मन्</span>). And *Atman*, something like that. So they're both, Greek and Sanskrit both have this common Indo-European ancestry we've talked about before.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[10:59-11:11]</span> So clearly these both derive from the same thing. And as I dug a little bit more deeply into the original uses of the word atmosphere in English,</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[11:11-11:25]</span> it seemed to be that the way that they were talking about it as the atmosphere is the why, this is so cool. This totally was like one of the coolest things that I've learned this month at least.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[11:25-11:38]</span> And so the reason they started calling it the atmosphere, the idea is that the planet, it's like this exhaling, it's like the breath of the planet, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[11:38-11:47]</span> So sort of like one atmosphere. So you've got that idea of the oneness, but also this sort of connection to breath, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[11:47-11:54]</span> So water vapor, so not water, but water vapor, which, you know, like your breath has water vapor, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[11:54-11:58]</span> So anyway, really, really cool, really cool connection.</p>

            <h3 id="section-11:59">Purusharthas Continued (Artha, Kama, Dharma, Moksha)</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[11:59-12:08]</span> *Purusharthas*. So the four *Purusha Arthas*. So *Purusha* means person and *Artha* means aim or goal.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[12:08-12:20]</span> *Artha* can mean a lot of different things. It kind of means pointing. But in this case, well, in this case, we've got two occurrences of the word *Artha* and they mean different things in both cases.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[12:20-12:53]</span> So *Purusha Artha*, meaning the aim or the goal of human persons. And the first of those is *Artha*, but with a different meaning. *Artha* in this case meaning wealth, but wealth we could get the wrong idea. I think we really mean just like material, having your needs met at a minimum, right? At a minimum having your, so you could think about it in terms of like Maslow's, the lowest rung of Maslow's hierarchy of needs. So, at the very least having your material needs met.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[12:53-13:19]</span> There are *shastras* or *sutras* associated with these. So books that are devoted entirely to the study of that thing. And so the *Artha Shastra* or the *Artha Sutras* are, you know, books, ancient books about the pursuit of, I mean they're business, they're business manuals, I think you could say, right? Manuals about business, how to run a business, how to manage finances and that sort of thing.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[13:24-13:30]</span> Second one is *Kama*. *Kama* meaning desire.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[13:30-13:40]</span> Really closely associated or very similar in meaning, philosophically and otherwise to the Greek word *Eros* (<span class="original-script">Ἔρως</span>).</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[13:40-13:52]</span> So if you've studied like Platonic, Plato's erotic dialogues or any sort of *Eros*, in Greek philosophy, serves a very, very similar function in both traditions.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[13:52-14:11]</span> Even a lot of the iconography is the same. So you've got *Eros* in the embodied form of *Eros*, like *Eros* as a, you know, when you see him, he's a him, right? When he's embodied, he has like a bow and arrow and he'll shoot you at Valentine's Day and, right, cause that desire.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[14:11-14:15]</span> *Kama* also shoots arrows. So very similar.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[14:15-14:20]</span> In terms of that. We'll come back to *Kama* later.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[14:20-14:30]</span> But the idea is that all humans have all four of these goals. So, and the pursuit of any one of them at the expense of the others could be detrimental, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[14:30-14:36]</span> So it's about finding a way to pursue all four in a way that doesn't contradict one another.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[14:36-14:52]</span> So, pursuing wealth as a human ideal, perfectly good, perfectly fine, perfectly nothing wrong with that whatsoever. It's something common human goal. But if you pursue wealth in a way that contradicts or controverts *Dharma*, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[14:52-14:58]</span> If I'm, if I get wealthy by stealing all of Luka's stuff, well, that's not *dharmic*, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[14:58-15:06]</span> So then I'd be violating this goal for the sake of this one, and the goal the idea is to pursue all of them, right? And to have a balance.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[15:06-15:17]</span> So, *Dharma*. *Dharma*, I think I tend to not translate, because it just means so many different things.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[15:17-15:24]</span> But to give you, I think justice and righteousness are good starting points for understanding *Dharma*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[15:24-15:32]</span> Then *Moksha*. *Moksha* we haven't encountered before. So, *Moksha* means liberation.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[15:32-15:47]</span> But for the different schools, the different perspectives on all of these things, we'll have different understandings of what that means. So liberation from what, liberation to what? How do we understand liberation? is going to be different.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[15:47-15:57]</span> But all of them have in mind this goal of liberation, right? Which could mean in the case of *Advaita*,</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[15:57-16:05]</span> so we've got skipping down to the *Trimarga*, three paths there, that we've covered before.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[16:05-16:21]</span> So the path of action or *karma*, so then, well, particularly the path of *Jnana*, so path of knowledge that we talked about in the last unit and we'll continue talking about.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[16:21-16:25]</span> In this case, *Moksha* would mean liberation from ignorance, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[16:25-16:34]</span> So if knowledge and wisdom is the goal, then ignorance would be that what you're liberated from, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[16:34-16:46]</span> And Shankara, the theologian that I've mentioned more than a few times now, the great theologian within from the *Advaita Vedanta* tradition, the non-dual tradition.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[16:46-16:56]</span> He points out that the scriptures are the only means to liberation. Have to have the scriptures. Can't get liberation without the scriptures.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[16:56-17:10]</span> But he also says that once you understand the scriptures, once you have that knowledge or wisdom, you don't need the scriptures anymore, right? Once you've once you understand the meaning of a book, you don't need the book anymore, right? Kind of thing.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[17:10-17:18]</span> And so *Moksha* in *Advaita*, first and foremost, I think means liberation from ignorance.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[17:18-17:28]</span> But it also ignorance of what? Ignorance of your identity with all, of your identity with *Brahman*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[17:28-17:44]</span> So then if I understand myself not just as like a me against the whole universe, right? Jaden versus everything that's not Jaden, right? So that would be a duelist. There's Jaden and then there's a whole world, whole universe, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[17:44-17:57]</span> But instead, *Moksha* would mean Jaden understanding herself as sort of like a, this is me, like a thread in the fabric of the cosmos to quote Brian Green.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[17:58-18:03]</span> So, yeah, good.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[18:03-18:12]</span> Now, how these get played out or interpreted in the different systems is going to vary widely, but we're just trying to get a grasp on it.</p>

            <h3 id="section-18:12">The Four Ashramas (Stages of Life)</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[18:12-18:16]</span> Four stages of life, so *Varna Ashrama*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[18:17-18:19]</span> I'll go over these very quickly.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[18:19-18:34]</span> *Brahmacharya* is the student stage. So, you recall when Udalaka, he sends his son Svetaketu off to school and he goes off for 12 years and then comes back.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[18:34-18:46]</span> That's really the *Brahmacharya* stage. But just because you go through all of that learning, just because you go through all that education, doesn't mean that you learn everything you're supposed to learn, right? Or understand everything you're supposed to understand.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[18:46-18:57]</span> So even though Svetaketu has technically sort of finished his *Brahmacharya* stage, he's not really ready to move on, right? He doesn't get it. He's conceited and arrogant, all those kind of things.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[18:59-19:04]</span> we study in the *Chandogya*. Then the *Grihasta*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[19:04-19:12]</span> So, *Grih*, it's where we get the English word grasp, come from the same root. So like holding, grasping, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[19:12-19:21]</span> And *hasta* means house. So like *Grihasta* is a house, usually translated householder, because that's literally what the word means.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[19:21-19:40]</span> So here we can understand this, this is a stage of life, right? So the stage of life where you own a house and usually have a spouse or partner, and you have kids, and you raise a family, right? So *Grihasta* is that huge stage portion of your life where you're doing those kind of activities.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[19:40-19:48]</span> *Vanaprastha*. *Vana* means forest and *prastha* is like somebody who lives in the forest. So *Vanaprastha* is a forest dweller.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[19:48-20:03]</span> The idea here is that when your kids grow up and your kids move out of the house, then you have a lot fewer financial responsibilities because you don't have to feed all these people anymore, right? You don't have to take care of those kind of things.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[20:03-20:16]</span> Often those the ideas that those grown children now, they take over a lot of the responsibilities of farming or business carrying on or whatever. So you don't really have to do those any those things anymore.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[20:16-20:21]</span> So the closest parallel in our in our culture to *Vanaprastha* would be retirement.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[20:21-20:28]</span> But the dominant activity, at least traditionally in the *Vanaprastha* stage, is philosophy.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[20:28-20:39]</span> So this is the time when you go off into the forest. Forest dweller doesn't necessarily mean that they live in the forest, although some, you know, although sometimes, maybe.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[20:39-20:54]</span> But maybe more that you leave your home in the morning and you go off into the forest or you go off to a library or you go off to place where there are other people and you sit around studying the scriptures, primarily the Upanishads or the other Vedas, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[20:54-21:06]</span> So you're think it's more it's a philosophical stage, a stage of inquiry, investigation, learning, but at that advanced stage of life, right? So retirement for scholarship and learning.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[21:06-21:12]</span> And then that would lead ideally to *Sannyasa*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[21:12-21:22]</span> So *Sannyasin* is the last stage of life. Or it's the, yeah, the last stage at least in this, in this framework.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[21:22-21:29]</span> *Sannyasin* is, if you go to India, lots of us going to India next week, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[21:29-21:34]</span> If you go to India, you'll see there's *Sannyasins* all over the place.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[21:34-21:55]</span> And so *Sannyasins* you'll be able to identify. Usually they have, usually they're wearing very, very simple clothing, meaning like a one long, it's almost like a night gown kind of thing, like one very plain cloth, like just like a long like a night robe, like a night gown, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[21:55-22:08]</span> And usually they're, they call them saffron. Saffron is a is an herb, like a spice. And it's deep red, but when you use that to color clothes, it can come out a wide range of shades.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[22:08-22:21]</span> So, I don't know, my experience, people call saffron clothes like a lot of different colors, anything ranging from like bright pink to kind of orange or red.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[22:21-22:27]</span> But if you see somebody wearing, you know, pink or orange or red robes, like simple clothing, especially if they're older.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[22:28-22:35]</span> So the idea is that during the *Vanaprastha* stage, you go off and you study the scriptures and all this kind of stuff. Hopefully, you attain enlightenment, state of, you know, non-duality or union with everything around you.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[22:42-22:55]</span> And once you reach that stage of enlightenment, then you renounce everything. You renounce all possessions, you even renounce your name, your family, you renounce everything. You have no possessions, no anything.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[22:55-23:04]</span> And on the most extreme version of it, be somebody who, yeah, like I said, renounces their name and they usually go somewhere where people don't know them, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[23:09-23:15]</span> So people don't know them in their old life, so that they can really be kind of anonymous.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[23:15-23:19]</span> They go, they sit in the streets usually with a bowl.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[23:19-23:31]</span> If you see somebody wearing the sort of *Sannyasin* robes and they're holding a bowl, typically, you're not ideally supposed to give them money, you're supposed to give them food, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[23:31-23:40]</span> So, and ideally, you should sit down with them and eat the food with them and study with them and learn from them and learn from their wisdom, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[23:40-23:45]</span> So give them food and share the food with them and learn from them.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[23:45-24:01]</span> Shankara, Shankara emphasizes that *Sannyasin* stage can come anytime, right? Because what identifies *Sannyasin* stage is not that you've gone through the other stages. He says you can go straight from *Brahmacharya* to *Sannyasin* stage.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[24:01-24:04]</span> All you have to do is reach enlightenment, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[24:04-24:13]</span> Shankara at least traditionally, attained *Sannyasin* stage as a teenager, so very young, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[24:13-24:19]</span> So anytime you have this understanding or moment of enlightenment, then you're *Sannyasin*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[24:19-24:23]</span> We'll come back to a lot of these things later when we get to the Bhagavad Gita.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[24:23-24:29]</span> By the way, the whole course, I think I've mentioned this before, but just to emphasize, this sorry Gail, did you have a question?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 5:</span> <span class="timestamp">[24:29-24:34]</span> Oh yeah, I was wondering, have you ever sat with someone in the Sannyasin stage in like India?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[24:34-24:35]</span> Yeah, for sure. What'd you learn?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[24:35-24:41]</span> I mean, so many of them. Yes, so so many of them. Yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 5:</span> <span class="timestamp">[24:41-24:44]</span> Oh, so it's like it's a common, like you don't just do it once. It's pretty common. Yeah. Yeah, it's pretty common.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[24:44-24:46]</span> Yeah. Yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 6:</span> <span class="timestamp">[24:46-24:51]</span> Is it common in all parts of India or where did you study in India?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[24:51-24:57]</span> So I've never been to northern half of India. I've only been to Southern India. I've been there many times. But so Bangalore is where I did my master's work and most of my work.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[24:57-25:11]</span> So Bangalore is like, if you chop India in half north to south, Bangalore is like in the middle of the southern half. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 7:</span> <span class="timestamp">[25:11-25:14]</span> Does it happen all over India?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[25:14-25:14]</span> It happened, yeah, of course. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 8:</span> <span class="timestamp">[25:15-25:19]</span> Have you ever sat with a Sannyasin?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[25:19-25:25]</span> No, I don't think so. Most people just give them some food or something and walk by. Yeah, money is like nothing.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 8:</span> <span class="timestamp">[25:25-25:28]</span> Yeah. Yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[25:28-25:30]</span> So, yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[25:31-25:32]</span> Good.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[25:34-25:59]</span> So the whole course, really the first half of the course, my plan is to prepare you for the second half of the course, right? So the whole course, everything we're doing now and everything we have done, everything we'll do between now and spring break is kind of leading up to or preparing you for the deep dive that we're going to do into the Gospel of John and the Bhagavad Gita.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[25:59-26:18]</span> And so I'll give a little bit more. I will talk about the gospel. No, the Gospel of John. Sorry, I've taught this class, I think this is my ninth time teaching the course. And every other time I've done the Gospel of Luke. This semester I decided to switch it up and do Gospel of John.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[26:18-26:25]</span> But everything's kind of leading up to that.</p>

            <h3 id="section-26:25">The Four Varnas (Divisions of Society)</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[26:25-26:39]</span> So we'll come back to these things more. Four divisions of society, we encountered these first in the in the Rig Veda, Rig Veda 1090, the *Purusha Sukta*, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[26:39-26:50]</span> So the one of the first texts that we read, in the beginning was this one person, and that one person, you know, like didn't have anything to do, pretty boring to just be the one thing in the universe.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[26:50-26:58]</span> So it unfolded or became many, right? And from that one person, from the head of that one person came the Brahmins.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[26:58-27:07]</span> These are really vocational distinctions between between the different parts of society.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[27:07-27:17]</span> Over time it has become associated more with birth, like socioeconomic often does become associated with who your parents are.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[27:17-27:26]</span> But from the scriptures, just reading the scriptures alone, it's just more functional or vocational.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[27:26-27:32]</span> So everybody that's Brahman, so Brahmans are scholars, teachers and priests.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[27:32-27:41]</span> And usually all three of those at the same time, right? Not drawing, you know, Boston College, you know, lots of people that check all of those boxes, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[27:41-27:44]</span> So Brahmans are in that category.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[27:44-27:48]</span> Or students who are preparing for that.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[27:48-27:53]</span> *Kshatriyas* spring from the shoulders and arms.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[27:53-28:00]</span> *Kshatriyas* is usually translated as warriors, but I think that's very misleading.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[28:00-28:07]</span> I think better would be to understand *Kshatriyas* as just anything that falls under the category of governing, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[28:07-28:16]</span> So everything from being the king, the *raja*, to, you know, metermaid, like writing parking tickets on Beacon Ave and everything in between, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[28:16-28:26]</span> So anything that has to do with governing would fall under the *Kshatriya* category.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[28:26-28:32]</span> And we're going to be shifting starting today to talk more about Krishna.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[28:32-28:37]</span> And so I'll just tell you now, Krishna is a *Kshatriya*. So it falls into this category.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[28:37-28:49]</span> From the lower regions come the *Vaishyas*. *Vaishyas* are anybody associated with pretty much anything that has to do with business, commerce, anything like that.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[28:49-28:58]</span> Every crafts people, merchants, business owners, you know, anything that has most things fall into that category.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[28:58-29:09]</span> *Sudras* spring from the feet of this one person, and they would include farmers, any kind of anybody who does sort of physical labor, that kind of stuff, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[29:09-29:15]</span> So the idea is that this, you know, together they make up this one person in order to have, you know, functioning society.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[29:16-29:20]</span> You really need all of these things, right? Can't really forego any of them in order to have a functioning society.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[29:24-29:32]</span> So the idea is to see society as one, right? As one person needing all of these different parts.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[29:32-29:52]</span> Obviously, if you're more familiar with the Christian New Testament, might you know, Paul's Paul's letter, Corinthians comes to mind when he talks about the, you know, all parts of society making up one person. It's very similar kind of passage.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[29:52-29:56]</span> So that's the four divisions of society.</p>

            <h3 id="section-29:56">Four Kinds of Sacred Texts (Shruti, Smriti, Itihasa, Purana)</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[29:56-30:05]</span> Four kinds of texts, we've talked about quite a bit. Particularly the first two. So *Shruti*, meaning that which is heard, that which is directly perceived, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[30:05-30:10]</span> And then the *Smriti*. *Smriti* means that which is remembered.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[30:10-30:13]</span> So it's sort of like one step removed, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[30:13-30:28]</span> So if Cameron told me something, then I've got first hand account of what Cameron told me, right? But if Stella comes along and says, you know, Cameron says this, then it's sort of like it's more it's one step removed. Makes sense, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[30:28-30:47]</span> So the idea is that *Shruti* is not only more authoritative, but it's really every every word, every grammatical structure, every, like the words are sacred, right? So the words themselves were heard.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[30:47-30:51]</span> So you want to make sure that you read and interpret every word.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[30:51-31:03]</span> So this was the idea behind the last podcast was to have you see how the words of this Upanishad and that Upanishad and that Upanishad, how they all fit together, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[31:03-31:13]</span> Because you've got to if every word matters and every text matters, then you want to make sure that you're reading this text in a way that's consistent with this other text too, right? So no cognitive dissonance or anything like that.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[31:15-31:34]</span> So in the case of creation stories, right? You've got hundreds, literally hundreds of creation stories and these in these texts, we've only read a small sampling of them, but then so to understand, what do we do with all these creation stories and how do you make sense of them, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[31:34-31:37]</span> And so that's the idea behind *Shruti*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[31:37-31:58]</span> *Smriti*, we've already read, so some a number of texts fit in multiple categories at the same time, right? So, the *Devi Mahatmya*, technically is a *Purana*, but really has attained the status of *Smriti*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[31:58-32:06]</span> So *Puranas* are legends, myths and stories, typically maybe always about deities.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[32:06-32:12]</span> And so the *Devi Mahatmya* are these legends, myths and stories about the goddess, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[32:12-32:20]</span> So we read a few of those. We read the story of Durga killing Mahishasura. We read the story of Kali taking out Raktabija, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[32:20-32:36]</span> Those are both from the *Devi Mahatmya*. So you know that they're, right, clearly fits in this category, but because of the importance of this particular text, it's reached the status of *Smriti*, particularly for those communities for whom it's important.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[32:36-32:49]</span> Then we've got next category oh, and the Bhagavad Gita would fit here too.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[32:50-33:01]</span> So basically *Devi Mahatmya* are the legends, myths and stories about *Shakta* or the goddess. Bhagavad Gita,</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[33:01-33:17]</span> well, it's not so much stories, it's one story, that again, is technically, well, it's technically *Itihasa*, the next one, but has achieved the status of *Smriti*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[33:18-33:26]</span> So *Itihasa*. *Itihasa* usually translated as histories, but they're really epics, they're like epic poems.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[33:26-33:36]</span> So the Mahabharata, Maha means great, so the great story of Bharata, which is a name for India before it was named India by outsiders.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[33:36-33:43]</span> But so the Mahabharata is this great epic and it's enormous.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[33:43-33:52]</span> It is the size of the of Homer's Odyssey and Iliad, it's twice the size of Homer's Odyssey and Iliad combined. So it's very, very big.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[33:52-34:00]</span> And out of this very, very big, just so many stories. It's, I mean, it's kind of one story, but it's really like a whole lot of stories.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[34:00-34:13]</span> We'll talk more about those stories later. But just trying to give you context, as much context as we can get today. So within the Mahabharata, out of those hundreds and hundreds of chapters, 18 of those hundreds and hundreds of chapters constitute the Bhagavad Gita.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[34:22-34:27]</span> So the Bhagavad Gita is 18 chapters out of this enormous epic.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[34:27-34:36]</span> And the Bhagavad Gita, as we will read, is the story of this dialogue between Krishna and Arjuna. Yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 9:</span> <span class="timestamp">[34:36-34:41]</span> Do different communities like all agree on which like what is Smriti or not or is it sort of like</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[34:41-34:51]</span> Good question. No, they don't. All of the, all of the orth, all of the *Shad Darshana*, all of the six systems, they all agree on *Shruti*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[34:51-35:00]</span> Although, there's a lot of Upanishads that's like, is this one Upanishad in there or not? So there's some dispute there. But pretty much, pretty much they all agree on that.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[35:00-35:16]</span> But then the *Devi Mahatmya*, for example, would be considered *Puranas* by the people who aren't Shaktas and would be considered *Smriti* by the people who are Shaktas.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[35:16-35:18]</span> Yeah. Bhagavad Gita,</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[35:18-35:28]</span> Bhagavad Gita has changed a lot over the last 150 years especially. Prior to that, it would have been considered *Smriti* for a relatively smaller group of</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[35:34-35:48]</span> Hindus. Now it's received, it's attained, mostly through this one political leader, during the anyway, getting off track. But yeah, good question. Yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[35:49-35:59]</span> *Itihasa*, I think everybody agrees on those. So the two main epics are the Mahabharata, as I just talked about and the Ramayana,</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[35:59-36:02]</span> which is also which is about Rama.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[36:02-36:11]</span> Story about Rama and his wife Sita. Sita gets stolen kidnapped by a demon and then Rama goes and rescues her, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[36:11-36:14]</span> That's the that's the short version. Longer version has more details.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[36:14-36:21]</span> And then, yeah, *Puranas*. So we're going to look a little bit today.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[36:22-36:41]</span> I'm going to show a couple videos of yeah, just cartoon versions or acted out *lilas*, version plays, performances, right? Plays of the of the *Puranas*. And not just any *Purana*, but the Bhagavata *Purana*, which I think I wrote somewhere.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[36:46-36:49]</span> Cool.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[36:49-36:55]</span> Questions so far? No, it's a lot I'm throwing at you today, but yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 10:</span> <span class="timestamp">[36:55-36:57]</span> Which one is the one that which is heard? *Shruti*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[36:57-37:01]</span> *Shruti* is that which is heard. So that's the highest level.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[37:01-37:04]</span> And, yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[37:04-37:15]</span> And the idea is once you understand the *Shruti*, it's not just that you've understood the text, but once you've understood the *Shruti*, you can hear it yourself, right? So it's it's like, yeah. Yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 11:</span> <span class="timestamp">[37:16-37:22]</span> So, Shruti, that which is heard, Smriti, that which is remembered, Itihasa?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[37:22-37:39]</span> *Itihasa*, epics, epic stories, epic poems, epic, I mean, technically, it means histories. But history's more emphasis on the story part of history than the</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 11:</span> <span class="timestamp">[37:39-37:42]</span> And then Puranas like legends. Puranas, legends and stories. Yeah. Yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[37:42-37:43]</span> Yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 12:</span> <span class="timestamp">[37:43-37:56]</span> Does Shruti kind of relate to like the clay analogy where it's like once you understand the clay, then you understand everything that's made up of the clay? Shruti is like you understand the words, then you understand everything that's made up of the words? Is that kind of a similar concept or is that distinct?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[37:57-37:58]</span> Yeah, yeah, maybe. Yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[38:00-38:01]</span> Okay.</p>

            <h3 id="section-38:03">Four Vedic Divisions & Text Types within Vedas</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[38:03-38:09]</span> Four kinds of texts we've talked about. Four traditions or divisions, Rig, Yaju, Sama, Atharva.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[38:10-38:17]</span> Rig, Yaju, Sama, Atharva. Usually I write Rig, Sama, Yaju, Atharva. I don't know why I wrote them in that order.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[38:17-38:22]</span> The four kinds of texts within each division. We've gone over those so many times, right? *Samhitas* are the hymns.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[38:23-38:26]</span> We read three of those.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[38:27-38:43]</span> The *Brahmanas* are the ritual texts. The *Aranyakas* are sort of these proto philosophical. I mean, but we read the *Brihad Aranyaka*. *Brihad* meaning big and *Aranyaka*, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[38:43-38:50]</span> So, *Brihad Aranyaka* is one of those that kind of fits in both of those categories.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[38:50-38:53]</span> Meaning that category and then Upanishad.</p>

            <h3 id="section-38:53">Etymology of Upanishad</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[38:53-39:08]</span> *Upanishad* is a discussion about some debate about the etymology of the word. And I mean debate among among the most authoritative theologians. Even Shankara gives two different etymologies of the word.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[39:08-39:16]</span> So on the one hand, most people say the etymology of the word means at the feet of the teacher, right? So Upanishad is you're studying at the feet of the teacher.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[39:18-39:37]</span> All of the Upanishads, virtually all of the Upanishads, are dialogues between teacher and student. So we saw Udalaka and his son, Svetaketu, and you know, all of these there's like, they're dialogues almost, almost always.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[39:37-39:54]</span> The other definition of the other etymology of Upanishad that Shankara gives is it's it's that which destroys. It's like it's destroys. What does it destroy? Of course, ignorance, right? So it's the destroyer of ignorance.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[39:54-40:08]</span> Which is which is important because it's not about giving you knowledge, right? It's not about teaching Jack something as much as it is eliminating Jack's ignorance, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[40:08-40:19]</span> So ignorance is ignoring, right? So ignoring the non-dual the non-duality yeah, of yourself and not self.</p>

            <h3 id="section-40:24">Trimarga (Three Paths: Karma, Jnana, Bhakti)</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[40:24-40:32]</span> Four levels of awareness. We've definitely gone over that, particularly in the Mandukya Upanishad. The *Trimarga*, I went over those, but I'll go over them again quickly.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[40:36-40:48]</span> So *Mimamsa* is *Karma Marga*, the path of action. *Moksha* through action. So *karma* is the means of liberation.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[40:48-41:01]</span> And *karma*, in particular, we'll come back to this when we get to the Bhagavad Gita, but *karma*, as I've said before, means performance of the Vedic rituals, which are described in the *Brahmanas*, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[41:01-41:14]</span> So, through performance, so when we say action, prior to the Bhagavad Gita, action or *karma* means the rituals, performance of the rituals. So that's the action that's meant here.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[41:15-41:21]</span> Vedanta is *Jnana Marga*, so the path of knowledge. So then *Moksha* means, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[41:23-41:28]</span> destroying *Moksha* or liberation from ignorance.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[41:28-41:34]</span> And *Bhakti Marga*, we'll look at more when we get to the Bhagavad Gita, but devotion, devotion to God, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[41:34-41:38]</span> So then if you're devoted to God, then God will take care of everything.</p>

            <h3 id="section-41:38">Major Divisions of Bhakti (Shakta, Shaiva, Vaishnava)</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[41:38-41:44]</span> Three plus major divisions of *Bhakti* today. Also went over these when I introduced the *Devi Mahatmya*, but</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[41:46-42:07]</span> just to it's a lot, so just to give it give you a little bit a little bit of a review. So there are roughly a third, roughly a third of all practicing Hindus today fall under the category of devotees of *Shakta*, *Shakti*. So the goddess, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[42:07-42:17]</span> So worshiping God in the form of Devi or in the form of the goddess, right? Durga or Kali or any of those.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[42:17-42:24]</span> About a third, a little less than a third, I would say, are devoted to</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[42:25-42:44]</span> or worshiping God in the form of Shiva. Unfortunately, we won't really be talking about that at all this semester. *Shaiva Siddhanta* is dope, super dope, but just kind of a little bit more advanced than what we can cover in an intro course.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[42:44-42:51]</span> And then *Vaishnava*. So we'll spend a lot of time from here on forward talking about *Vaishnavism*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[42:51-43:01]</span> *Vaishnava*, can be divided into or separated, I guess.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[43:01-43:07]</span> So there's *Vaishnava*, which is worship of God in the form of Vishnu.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[43:07-43:14]</span> Vishnu is really, really only a name that's used in the in the *Shruti*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[43:14-43:22]</span> It doesn't come up that much elsewhere other than to say this is an *avatara* of Vishnu. We'll come up come back to that word in a second.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[43:22-43:32]</span> So you've got *Vaishnava* traditions which are devotion to God in the form of Vishnu.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[43:32-43:43]</span> And then *Shri Vaishnava*, which is devotion to God in the form of Vishnu with Shri. Shri is the feminine, the feminine consort, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[43:43-43:58]</span> So the idea of *Shri Vaishnava* traditions is that you can never think about, you can never properly think about God without having both the masculine and the feminine together, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[43:58-44:07]</span> So masculine and feminine don't collapse into one. Masculine is masculine, feminine is feminine, but you can never have one without the other. Yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 13:</span> <span class="timestamp">[44:07-44:11]</span> Could you repeat what's the deal with Shiva?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[44:11-44:26]</span> Shiva? So devotion to God or worship of God in the form of Shiva. And I didn't really say much about it other than we're not really talking about it that much this semester.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[44:26-44:33]</span> But Shiva is just another another form of the divine. And, yeah, I would be happy to talk about it a little bit more later, but that's all you need to know for now.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[44:38-44:40]</span> Yeah. Yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 14:</span> <span class="timestamp">[44:40-44:42]</span> A question. How many gods are there?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[44:42-44:43]</span> 330 million.</p>
            <p><span class="description">[44:44-44:49] *(laughter)*</span></p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 14:</span> <span class="timestamp">[44:49-44:52]</span> But they mostly just worship a few of them or?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[44:52-44:57]</span> Well, come back to that maybe. Yeah. So,</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[44:58-45:05]</span> I mean, the idea is that God is infinite, right? So then infinite God has an infinite number of forms, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[45:05-45:10]</span> So, but you can't picture infinite, right? Infinite, if you picture it, it's not infinite, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[45:13-45:24]</span> So the idea is that an infinite an infinite deity would need an infinite number of forms and any one of these forms will suffice, right? We'll come back to that question. Yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 15:</span> <span class="timestamp">[45:25-45:33]</span> Is there something particularly special about the form of Vishnu that makes it or him or her more worth worshipping as opposed to all the others?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[45:34-45:39]</span> I mean, for the Vaishnavas would answer that differently than the Shaktas, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[45:40-45:46]</span> Yeah, I don't think I need to tackle that one right now either. Yeah. Other questions that I'm not going to answer?</p>
            <p><span class="description">[45:48-45:49] *(laughter)*</span></p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[45:49-45:50]</span> Cool.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[45:54-45:59]</span> Fun fact, I was challenged to a duel. Yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[45:59-46:04]</span> I didn't accept the challenge.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[46:05-46:19]</span> Yeah, I was, I was, this is a tiny bit of a flex, but I was on the, the Board of Review at Harvard Theological Review.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[46:18-46:37]</span> So like if you're going to get something published at Harvard Theological Review, you submit your paper and if it had anything to do with Hindu theology or or some or comparative theology, had to go through me, right? And then so, mostly my job was to reject papers or come up with a good reason to reject papers.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[46:37-46:54]</span> Anyway, this guy wrote wrote a paper and he was arguing something about the 108 *Divyadeshas* of the Shri Vaishnava tradition in Southern India and he had like identified these 108 locations.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[46:54-47:05]</span> And 108 is like a super special, super auspicious number. Very few people think that it means that there's 108 of them. It's just like a special number. You know what I'm saying?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[47:05-47:15]</span> So, but he really wanted to categorize and identify which of the thousands of places that can claim to be one of the 108 were the actual 108.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[47:15-47:24]</span> Anyway, I rejected it. But he, he resubmitted the article after revising it and I had to review that as well.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[47:24-47:42]</span> And in one of the footnotes, he directly challenged me, the reviewer who rejected his first proposal to a public duel and he had a place and time. I'm going to be at this place. It was like Chennai, you know, on this date and, you know, you I'll see you there basically. It was like</p>
            <p><span class="description">[47:42-47:43] *(laughter)*</span></p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[47:43-47:44]</span> That was kind of cool.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 16:</span> <span class="timestamp">[47:44-47:45]</span> Swords or pistols?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[47:45-47:51]</span> I think it was, you know, I mean, no, I think it was like a public debate, yeah. But I called it a duel.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[47:51-47:53]</span> Moving on.</p>

            <h3 id="section-47:59">Astika vs. Nastika Traditions (Authority of the Veda)</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[47:53-47:59]</span> *Smarta Brahmins* we can leave aside.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[47:59-48:05]</span> Authority of the Veda. So there's two, this is more meta than the *Shad Darshana*, right? So *Shad Darshana* is pretty meta.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[48:05-48:15]</span> Meaning these six orthodox, six orthodox perspectives. But what makes them orthodox is that they're *Astika*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[48:15-48:24]</span> *Astika*, literally the word means person who says yes, but what it means is they say yes to the Vedas, meaning the Vedas, the Veda, Vedas, are sacred, right? Sacred revelation.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[48:30-48:43]</span> So the *Astika* traditions are the ones that we're studying this in this class. So those traditions that say yes to the Veda, meaning the Veda is is sacred.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[48:43-48:51]</span> *Nastika* are other, you know, traditions, Indian theological traditions that say no to the Veda.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[48:51-49:01]</span> And the most, the most prominent among these are Jainism, which I would love to smuggle somewhere into the smuggle into the course somewhere, if we can.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[49:01-49:07]</span> But Jainism is as old as Buddhism, but not as well known.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[49:07-49:11]</span> But they say they reject the authority of the Veda.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[49:11-49:14]</span> Buddha also. Buddha when he was, if you've</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[49:14-49:23]</span> studied Buddha at all, you know that the Buddha grew up a very sheltered life, right? Helicopter parents, all that kind of stuff. Then when he became an adult, he left the palace and learned about suffering and all these kind of, you know, injustices in the world.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[49:30-49:37]</span> And at that point, he began his journey, his long journey of studying philosophy and theology.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[49:37-49:41]</span> And he studied with a *Sannyasin*. So he encountered a *Sannyasin*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[49:42-49:58]</span> One of the things that surprised him about the *Sannyasin* is the *Sannyasin* was crazy poor, totally like old, dying, sick, you name it, right? All the things that nobody wants to be. But he was crazy happy, like super happy, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[50:01-50:09]</span> And the Buddha was super confused, like how can you have such a shitty life and be so happy, so fulfilled and all this kind of stuff.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[50:09-50:13]</span> So he started studying with the *Sannyasin*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[50:13-50:27]</span> We don't know exactly what he taught this taught the Buddha, but pretty safe bet that it's a lot of the same stuff that we've been studying, right? The Upanishads or earlier versions of the Upanishads at least.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[50:27-50:36]</span> So studying studying all those things. And the Buddha at first was super into it. He was very, very into it.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[50:36-50:43]</span> But at some point became disenchanted with it and said, no, this this ain't quite doing it for me.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[50:43-50:46]</span> And then said no to the Vedas, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[50:46-50:56]</span> So then he came up with his own philosophy after that, which is certainly not unrelated to non-dualism, but but different nonetheless.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[50:56-51:03]</span> So that's *Astika* and *Nastika*, but really this class we're just talking about *Astika* traditions.</p>

            <h3 id="section-51:03">Shad Darshana (Six Orthodox Systems) Overview</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[51:03-51:06]</span> *Shad Darshana*, certainly</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[51:07-51:13]</span> have plenty of insight about those. *Nyaya* and *Vaisheshika*, logic and atomism, went over those the other day.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[51:13-51:19]</span> Adam, matter and energy, teach that God is the author of the Vedas.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[51:19-51:26]</span> Moving to *Sankhya* and *Yoga*, dualist, *Purusha*, *Prakriti*, two bed sheets, matter and energy, all those kind of things that we talked about.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[51:26-51:33]</span> The existence or non-existence of God is really just not even talked about, just not even covered.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[51:33-51:46]</span> So, God doesn't, the word God doesn't really come up in any of those texts. And when it does, there's nothing really profound said about. So it's just really non-theistic, I think would be the best description.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[51:46-51:50]</span> *Moksha*. Okay, so here's one thing that I haven't given.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[51:50-51:55]</span> So, right, going back to the bed sheets analogy, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[51:55-52:02]</span> So, like, if I push down on these, then anytime you have this joining, yeah, a joining of spirit and matter.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[52:05-52:17]</span> Then we get, you know, an Eric or a Jorge or a Luka, right? So Luka is matter and spirit, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[52:17-52:20]</span> So, and they aren't joined.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[52:20-52:33]</span> So then what would *Moksha* mean? Because it's not really separation would be death, right? So *Moksha* in this case, means more like balance, I would say, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[52:33-52:41]</span> So, if you, I'm sure any BC students very familiar with this issue, like where you get super in your head, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[52:41-52:51]</span> Like you just can't, like sometimes you're just so into your head that you don't even know what's going around you, right? Maybe some of you are there right now. It's like super in your head that you're not aware of what's going on around you, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[52:57-53:09]</span> Sometimes it can go the other way, right? If you're in a state of, if you feel like you're in danger or uncomfortable or you're in the club and you don't know anybody, just my experience.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[53:08-53:16]</span> Then, like, you know, you're super hyper aware of everything around you and you're not in your head, you're very much in your body, you know what I mean?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[53:16-53:24]</span> So yoga then, we could understand *Moksha* in the yoga tradition is more is finding the right balance between these two, right? Finding a harmony between.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[53:24-53:33]</span> So if you're talking about yogic exercises, yoga *asana*, which is what most people think of when they think of yoga. It's about finding the balance, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[53:33-53:47]</span> A lot of yogic practices about the breath, breath control, and a lot of that is about quieting your mind, getting your mind and your body in the right balance, the right harmony, you could say, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[53:47-53:58]</span> So that's *Moksha* in those traditions. And then *Moksha* in Vedanta is, like I said, liberation from ignorance.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[53:58-54:13]</span> I gave you a little bit more there. So I gave you the first line from the *Purva Mimamsa Sutras*, *Athato Dharma Jijnasa*, which,</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[54:12-54:17]</span> just means now then an investigation into *Dharma*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[54:17-54:33]</span> So *Mimamsa* is focused on *Dharma*, but like I said, how *Dharma* is achieved is by understanding the Vedic rituals properly and not just understanding them properly, but doing them, right? So the action, the *karma* of doing the rituals is what really matters.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[54:33-54:43]</span> And the Veda tells us what is to be done, so something futural, right? Something that needs to be brought into being, and and how, that's the methods of the rituals.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[54:43-54:50]</span> I gave this early in the semester too, but just to repeat it, *Shabdamatram Devata*, God is nothing but a word.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[54:50-55:01]</span> So the most important thing for the *Mimamsakas*, I mean, most important thing about God, for the *Mimamsakas* is that you pronounce the word properly and at the right time, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[55:01-55:07]</span> And the only thing that really matters or special about the word is that it's in the dative, right? Because you can't give, you can't, you can't sacrifice unless you're sacrificing to something, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[55:11-55:13]</span> And so you need that word there.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[55:14-55:26]</span> The scriptures are *ananta* and *apaurusheyatva*. So *ananta* just means endless or eternal and *apaurusheyatva* means not from human origin. So not not authored.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[55:27-55:31]</span> They're just there to be heard, right? *Shruti* means heard.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[55:31-55:40]</span> Vedanta, the Vedanta Sutras begin *Athato Brahma Jijnasa*. So now then an investigation into Brahma.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[55:40-55:45]</span> Primarily concerned with the Upanishads. All these things I've said so many times.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[55:46-55:48]</span> We'll come back to that *Satkaryavada* later.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[55:48-55:57]</span> There are numerous schools within Vedanta. *Advaita* and *Vishishta Advaita* are the only two that we're really talking about this semester, although *Tantra* is definitely,</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[55:59-56:03]</span> would be cool too. Probably less appropriate for Boston College.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[56:03-56:09]</span> Just because it has to do with sex. A lot of sex.</p>
            <p><span class="description">[56:09-56:10] *(laughter)*</span></p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[56:12-56:15]</span> I said sex. Sex.</p>
            <p><span class="description">[56:15-56:16] *(laughter)*</span></p>

            <h3 id="section-56:16">Key Terms Across Traditions (Karma, Dharma, Moksha, Atman, Brahman)</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[56:16-56:22]</span> Then, all of these words there, *Karma*, *Dharma*, *Moksha*, *Atman*, and *Brahman*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[56:22-56:32]</span> These are really important terms for all of these six perspectives, but they're understood quite differently by all of these six perspectives.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[56:32-56:43]</span> So understanding the nuances and the differences, sometimes significant differences between them. So they're using the same word, but often in very different ways, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[56:43-56:55]</span> But we're only studying, we're mostly studying Vedanta, and these two versions of Vedanta, *Advaita Vedanta* and *Vishishta Advaita Vedanta*, which we need to get to.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[56:55-57:04]</span> *Karma* means action, *Samskara* means trace. We'll come back to that later.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[57:04-57:11]</span> On the back side, I gave you the four *Mahavakyas*. Definitely not going to review those now, because we've reviewed them a lot.</p>

            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[57:11-57:20]</span> I want to shift gears now in the last 20 minutes, 19 minutes. But any questions about any of that stuff?</p>

            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[57:24-57:31]</span> Good. Then, let's talk a little bit about this kid named Krishna.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[57:31-57:36]</span> So, you got there that blank spot, Bhagavata *Purana*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[57:36-57:47]</span> So it's one of the *Puranas*. These are the, so in the same way that the *Devi Mahatmya* is a *Purana* about Devi, the Bhagavata *Purana* is a *Purana* that's about Krishna.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[57:47-57:51]</span> Or Vishnu, but mostly Krishna.</p>

            <h3 id="section-57:51">Concept of Avatara (Divine Descent)</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[57:51-57:59]</span> So Krishna is an *avatara*. The word *avatara* means descent.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[57:59-58:11]</span> It will be, this is one of the main reasons I won't was interested in studying John's gospel together with the Bhagavad Gita because I think we could say that the,</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[58:12-58:21]</span> Luke's understanding of Jesus as Christ is quite significantly different than *avatara*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[58:21-58:26]</span> But John's, maybe not so much. So we'll, anyway, I'm getting ahead of myself. We'll look at that later. But *avatara* means descent.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[58:27-58:31]</span> So different than an incarnation. Incarnation is like you've got a body and then and a spirit becomes incarnate in the meat, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[58:36-58:39]</span> *Carne* meaning the flesh. So, the spirit</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[58:40-58:42]</span> enters the flesh. But *avatara* is a bit different.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[58:43-58:58]</span> *Avatara* sort of like directly descends, right? So God descends, not taking sort of physical form, but appearing as physical form, appearing as a person, but never stopping being.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[58:58-59:07]</span> So in, in orth, in traditional Christian theology, certainly those in my class last semester learned, you've got the dual nature of Christ.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[59:09-59:14]</span> Christ is considered both fully human and fully divine. *Avatars* are not not the case at all.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[59:16-59:20]</span> *Avatars* are fully divine, period, not human, fully divine.</p>

            <h3 id="section-59:20">The Ten Avatars of Vishnu (Brief Overview & Narasimha Story)</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[59:20-59:28]</span> So Krishna is one of those avatars, but one of 10. So I give you the list 10 avatars of Vishnu.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[59:28-59:47]</span> The first three all have to do with the great flood. So *Matsya* rescued the rescued the earth, rescued Manu, the first person, like sort of the Adam, from a flood. *Kurma* rescued the earth from a great flood. *Varaha* rescued the earth from a great flood.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[59:47-59:51]</span> *Narasimha*. So let me tell the story of *Narasimha* super fast.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[59:52-59:59]</span> So, just sort of like as a as as an example of these sort of tropes.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[59:59-1:00:12]</span> So, when I taught the *Devi Mahatmya*, I gave you this I said the most of these *Puranas*, most of these myths and stories follow pretty similar trope, or at least there's a super common trope.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:00:12-1:00:31]</span> And that trope is that, you know, somebody somebody gets, somebody does some good stuff, right? Addison goes and he does some good stuff. And then the gods are like, whoa, look at what Addison's doing. Let's give Addison some more power, right? And then so that he can do more good stuff.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:00:31-1:00:49]</span> And then Addison does more good stuff. Cycle continues until finally Addison gets like all up in his head and he's like, I'm the greatest ever and I'm just going to I got a mandate to do everything. And then, then the gods are like, oh, snap, we got to intervene here, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:00:49-1:01:15]</span> So the story of *Narasimha* follows the same basic trope. You've got this kid with I just one of the coolest names ever. I briefly thought for like five minutes about naming my son Hiranyakashipu and then that that was suggested that that might not be the best idea. But Hiranyakashipu, it's kind of just a fun name to say, isn't it? So Hiranyakashipu, let's all say it together. Hiranyakashipu. Perfect. That's exactly right. Nailed it.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:01:22-1:01:32]</span> So Hiranyakashipu was, you know, he was he did some good stuff. The gods were like, yo, let's give Hiranyakashipu some some rewards. And</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:01:33-1:01:41]</span> he was like, you know, I want to be immortal. I want to be I want I want to live forever, be immortal.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:01:41-1:01:45]</span> And they were like, bro, that's like the one thing we can't do. We're not going to do that, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:01:45-1:01:56]</span> And he's like, okay, fine. Well, how about I don't want to be killed inside or outside, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:01:56-1:01:58]</span> And they're like, yeah, sure, okay, we can do that.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:01:58-1:02:08]</span> You can't be killed inside or outside. He does some more good stuff. He gets another boon. He's like, I don't want to be killed during the day or during the night. And they're like, sure, we can do that for you.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:02:08-1:02:17]</span> And then does some more good stuff. And he's like, I don't want to kill, I don't want to be killed by a human or, you know, a non-human beast.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:02:17-1:02:23]</span> And they're like, sure, we can do that, right? Etc, etc. Some more, you get the gist, right? It goes on.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:02:23-1:02:33]</span> Hiranyakashipu becomes bad guy, right? And they're like, oh, we got to intervene and, you know, do something.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:02:33-1:02:41]</span> So they all go to Vishnu. People go and appeal to Vishnu, pray to Vishnu. Hey, can you take care of this kid?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:02:41-1:02:53]</span> Right? We saw the same exact trope in the *Devi Mahatmya* and all the gods pull their power together, give their power over, and then Devi is the manifestation, embodiment of that power, pure power.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:02:53-1:02:58]</span> Here, Vishnu's like, I don't need anybody else. I can do it. Take care of it.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:02:58-1:03:06]</span> And so Vishnu descends and he descends and takes the form of *Narasimha*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:03:06-1:03:14]</span> So *Nara* meaning man and *Simha* meaning lion, like Simba, like the Lion King, right? So *Narasimha*, half man, half lion.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:03:14-1:03:20]</span> He appears at dusk. So it's neither day nor night.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:03:20-1:03:23]</span> So he's not a man or a lion, he's a man lion, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:03:23-1:03:31]</span> And it's neither day nor night, it's like dusk. He appears in like the door jam, you know, of the house.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:03:31-1:03:35]</span> So he's neither inside nor outside. You get the gist, right? And then he, he I got a picture.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:03:37-1:04:10]</span> Um, he, usually *Narasimha* has his hands like inside of his, he's disemboweling him. And in a lot of the depictions, a lot of depictions, Hiranyakashipu is like pretty stoked about this whole thing because he's like in God's lap and God is like got his hands all over him and he's like, what's not, you know, it's nice being so close to God.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:04:27-1:04:30]</span> Too bad he's like ripping my bowels out.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:04:30-1:04:33]</span> So anyway, that's one of the avatars. That's *Narasimha*.</p>

            <h3 id="section-1:04:43">Focus on Krishna & Bala Krishna</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:04:33-1:04:43]</span> Lots of other stories with these other avatars. But for most of this semester from here forward, we'll be talking about Krishna.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:04:43-1:04:48]</span> And so Krishna is another avatar. And Krishna's,</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:04:51-1:05:01]</span> I think fair to say, Vanya could probably tell you Krishna's pretty popular, right? Krishna's kind of everywhere. You go to India, you see Krishna everywhere.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:05:01-1:05:10]</span> And probably most popular in his form as *Bala Krishna*. So *Bala* means child.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:05:10-1:05:13]</span> So Krishna as as in the form of a child.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 17:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:05:13-1:05:13]</span> It's *Bal*.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:05:13-1:05:17]</span> *Bal*? *Bal*, yeah, *Bala*, *Bal*. Okay.</p>

            <h3 id="section-1:10:21">Discussion of the Krishna Story (Lila, Relationship vs. Worship)</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:10:21-1:10:29]</span> So, a couple things about this couple things about this story. One is in the Bhagavata *Purana* version, the the original version of the story.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:10:30-1:10:41]</span> So Yashoda looks into his mouth and she sees the entire universe as you saw. But it kind of zooms more and more in.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:10:41-1:10:53]</span> And finally, you know, starts like seeing the whole universe and then galaxies and then, you know, the the planet, and zooming in, and she winds up seeing herself looking into Krishna's mouth, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:10:53-1:10:59]</span> So she sees, yeah, so it's sort of this whole Klein bottle inside outside, you know, kind of thing.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:10:59-1:11:08]</span> And then after that, like she didn't know, like it's kind of trippy, right? So she doesn't know how to respond.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:11:08-1:11:13]</span> But she realizes that he's, you know, God, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:11:13-1:11:22]</span> And so she she does what I think, you know, most people do, which is like kneel down and pray to him, right? Give him homage, like pray to pray to him as God because she realizes he's God.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:11:24-1:11:28]</span> And he's like, this like not what Krishna's about, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:11:28-1:11:34]</span> Like he didn't come to be worshiped or served or venerated or any of that kind of stuff, right? He came to play.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:11:34-1:11:37]</span> The whole point of of being is to play.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:11:37-1:11:47]</span> He comes down sometimes to like take care of bad guys that are destroying the play, right? But he really came down to to play and to to be, just to be, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:11:47-1:11:53]</span> So he does not want her to worship him and he's bothered by the fact that she's worshiping him.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:11:53-1:11:59]</span> So, what does she do? She erases his mind, he erases her mind, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:11:59-1:12:08]</span> So that she he causes her to forget that he's God, right? That he's Vishnu in avatar form.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:12:07-1:12:12]</span> so that she can go back because what he wants her to be is his mom and what he wants to be is her child, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:12:12-1:12:19]</span> So they're playing these roles and he wants her to play that role. He doesn't want her to worship him. Yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 18:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:12:19-1:12:27]</span> You say that they're that the Avatara aren't human though, like Jesus? Where does that come into play? It seems like they want that human relationship.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:12:27-1:12:32]</span> So he's pretend he's playing as a human and he wants that relationship very much so, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:12:32-1:12:45]</span> And so he can, so yeah, he that's really the form, that's really why Krishna has come is just to be in relationship with with others, right?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 18:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:12:45-1:12:51]</span> Is that different from Jesus though in Christian texts, you know, where Jesus is kind of doing the same thing wants to be Sure.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:12:51-1:12:54]</span> I mean, I think that aspect is not very different. Yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> <span class="timestamp">[1:12:54-1:13:13]</span> But the the point I was trying to draw is between traditional notion of incarnation versus Krishna isn't an incarnation, he's he's God descending and God form, right? Cool. Good.</p>
