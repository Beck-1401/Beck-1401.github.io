        <img src="RQ_03_27_1.jpg" alt="Here's a detailed description of the image:

**Overall Scene:**

The image appears to be taken in a classroom or study area.  There are several tables in the scene, and the focus is on the items on one of the tables and a coat draped over a chair. In the background, people are visible, suggesting an active environment.

**Foreground:**

*   **Table:** A wooden table dominates the foreground.
*   **Items on the Table:**
    *   An open book, likely a textbook or reference book, with numerous pages of text visible.
    *   A spiral notebook with lined paper and some handwritten notes is on the right side of the book, a pencil rests on the pages.
    *   A binder with papers.
    *   A book, perhaps similar to the one open.
*   **Coat:**  A tan-colored coat is draped over the back of the chair.  It appears to be made of a wool-like material.

**Midground:**

*   **Tables and Activities:**  More tables are visible, with what looks like a Jenga game set up on one of them, and other miscellaneous items. People are standing and interacting around the tables in the background.
*   **Flooring:** The floor has a neutral-toned carpet with a geometric pattern.

**Background:**

*   **People:**  Several people are standing and/or moving around.

**Lighting and Composition:**

*   **Lighting:** The lighting appears to be a mix of natural and artificial light, creating a somewhat diffused illumination.
*   **Composition:** The image is taken from a slightly low angle, focusing primarily on the contents of the table and the coat, with the background providing context of the environment." style="max-width:500px; margin: 10px auto; display: block; width: auto; height: 500px;">

        <h1>Gospel of John (Chapters 10-13) Class Discussion</h1>

        <h2 id="synopsis">Synopsis</h2>
        <p>
            The class began slightly late, followed by a brief moment of presence and breathing led by Brad. Brad offered the class options for an opening activity: playing Jenga or revisiting Jeopardy questions. The class, particularly the group leaders, voted for Jenga. A significant portion of the initial class time was dedicated to playing Jenga, involving group leaders and other students. Following the game, the class transitioned into a discussion focused on the Gospel of John, specifically chapters 10 through 13. Students raised questions and shared interpretations regarding Jesus's analogies (the shepherd and the gate), the nature of belief versus seeing signs, the timing of salvation (before and after Jesus), Jesus's humanity and relatability (e.g., weeping), apparent contradictions in his statements (judging vs. saving), and the role of the "beloved disciple." Comparisons were drawn to the Bhagavad Gita regarding the transmission of teachings and the need for structure in religion. The discussion also touched upon blind faith versus questioning faith, and the importance of community in religious experience, exemplified by a student's experience with Greek Orthodox services. Brad concluded the class by clarifying the requirements for the upcoming podcast assignment, emphasizing the rotation of text focus between the Bhagavad Gita and the Gospel of John based on group leadership roles.

            <li>
                <span class="vocabulary-term">Bhagavad Gītā (भगवद् गीता)</span>: <span class="timestamp">(approx. 27:40, 38:40)</span> A major Hindu scripture, discussed in comparison to the Gospel of John regarding the transmission of divine teachings and the potential for the message to degrade over time, requiring divine intervention (like Krishna's) to reset it.

            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 id="key-takeaways">Key Takeaways</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Jesus's metaphors in John 10 (Shepherd, Gate) raise complex questions about exclusivity, salvation for those before him, and his dual roles.</li>
            <li>The Gospel of John emphasizes belief, but students questioned how faith is cultivated without Jesus's physical presence and signs, contrasting it with the disbelief of some who witnessed miracles.</li>
            <li>Jesus's depicted humanity (e.g., weeping in John 11) makes him relatable and trustworthy for some, while others in the text struggled to reconcile his humanity with his claims of divinity.</li>
            <li>Apparent contradictions within the text (e.g., Jesus coming to judge vs. not coming to judge) provoke discussion about interpretation and the multifaceted nature of his role.</li>
            <li>The need for religious structure and guidance was discussed as a human desire, contrasting with the simple call to "be nice."</li>
            <li>Faith can involve both intellectual seeking/questioning (theology as "faith seeking understanding") and experiential connection through community and ritual, even without full linguistic comprehension (Greek Orthodox example).</li>
            <li>The figure of the "disciple whom Jesus loved" is introduced in John 13, an important recurring element in this Gospel.</li>
            <li>There's a tension explored between internal belief/love/intention and the necessity of backing up faith with action (highlighted by Peter's impending denial).</li>
        </ul>

            <p><span class="speaker">Student 1:</span> How do y'all?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Sorry I'm late. I was in my office reading the Gospel of John and lost track of time. Let's take a moment and just be present.</p>
            <p><i>[Chime sounds]</i></p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Let's take a breath together. Go ahead and breathe in. And let it out.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Alrighty. So, I did bring Jenga today, thought we could. So we have several options. I brought Play-Doh, of course, as always, if anybody wants Play-Doh, go and break, take one and pass, or just pass. I feel so authoritative up here, like separated from everybody and everything.</p>

            <h3 id="outline-1">Activity Choice: Jenga vs. Jeopardy</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> So yeah, so option one would be to play Jenga. It's a nice physical-ish exercise. The other option would be to play the Jeopardy game again, but I don't have any Gospel of John related questions at the moment. So it would be the questions that we've already done.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Any thoughts on those two options?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Group leaders, who we've got today? We've got Reagan and Sailor and Sophia, and Tushar, Liam. Wait, Liam's in the other class, right? Is Liam's in the other class?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 1:</span> He's not here.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Got it. And Riley, yeah. And Sean, yep. So Sailor, Sean, Sophia, Riley, Reagan, Tushar, right? And Liam-ish.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Cool. How about you, how about those folks? Do you have a vote on Jenga or Jeopardy?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 1:</span> Jenga.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Jenga? Jenga? Jenga? Jenga? Sounds like Jenga wins. All right, let's just play Jenga. You want to do just the, just the group leaders? We got a nice, we got a nice center.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 1:</span> Wait, can I fill in for Liam?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Yeah, you can fill in for Liam. Yeah, that's right, because your team doesn't have a leader today, right? Yeah. Yeah. Absolutely.</p>

            <p class="small-group-note">[10:46-15:44 - Small group discussion during Jenga play]</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Alright, cool and the gang. Well, that was fun. Let's turn to the fourth gospel now.</p>

            <h3 id="outline-3">Discussion: Gospel of John Ch. 10 - Shepherd/Gate Analogy</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> So, yeah, I'm going to let I'm going to turn it over to y'all. So, why don't we start with the chapter we did chapter nine, so now we're starting chapter 10, yeah? Yep. So anybody want to get us started? Sean, kick it off.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 7:</span> Just start off with the the shepherd and the gate analogy. I was confused about why Jesus called himself the gate and the shepherd. Yeah. Because I feel like you can't be both at once, especially when you're walking through the gate to get in to steal and be a thief. And then I also thought about it too that if he's the first shepherd, then what about the people or the sheep? I'm I'll use sheep and like people like interchangeably. Like the people before that were in the gate. Like are they saved? Are they not? Because they didn't go through the gate. They didn't go in through Jesus. So I thought about that question.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Okay, all right. Yeah? Yeah, Reagan.</p>

            <h3 id="outline-4">Discussion: Belief Before/After Jesus & Absence of Signs</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 8:</span> Go off that, I think I was also just wondering if like everybody before Jesus was almost like doomed because they didn't have him as their shepherd because he talks about how like in chapter 10 verse 8, all who came before me are thieves and bandits. And then he talks about how he's like the savior that if like whoever believes in him will be saved, but it's like so is all of humanity before him like just like non-savable? So I thought that was kind of interesting.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Solid question. Yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 7:</span> Like same thing with that too, that was a better way to put it. And I also thought of like the people after Jesus, like when Jesus died, like how are you going to enter in that gate and be saved if there is no Jesus? So like on like both sides of that before and after, like there wasn't really a lot of mention of like what you could do after that. So it could just be the way the text was written where it was more talking in the present tense. Mhm. Not thinking of the past or the future, but like reading it now like so many years later, like that's something that definitely comes to mind.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Okay, yeah, good. Yeah, Riley.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 9:</span> I feel like also like in a little bit of a different direction of thinking about this, but like with the signs and how Jesus is like showing people signs during this time period and like that's how they start to like grow faith in him. But like now, since like Jesus isn't here in the present moment, like in what way like do we grow faith in him? That's what I'm thinking about.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> So his absence, his presence seems to be a source of faith, so then in that absence. Yeah, good question. Yeah, Tushar.</p>

            <h3 id="outline-5">Discussion: Belief Despite Presence & Jesus's Humanity</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 10:</span> So like add on to that John 10 line 28. I give I give them eternal life and they will never perish. No one will snatch them out of my hand. What my father has given me is greater than all else and no one can snatch it out of the father's hand. The father and I are one. So like this like affirms Jesus's like authority, but like in a way they people are more willing to like believe in Jesus and his powers now than back then when he was present and like proving himself. So I just I like that where he had to put in the work for his legacy to like continue to like this day where like most people are practicing Catholic and Christian religions and believing in Jesus Christ. Well back then is like even though the proof was in front of you, no one like most people weren't believing in him.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Yeah, okay, good. So it's all of them see the the proof in front of their eyes and some believe and some don't. Yeah. Yeah, Alec.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 11:</span> What's interesting to me is that like I wonder if Jesus was like looked more like a Hindu god, you know, like being blue or having the universe in his mouth or something like that if then we would have believed him. It's interesting that it's like we don't really trust other people. So I feel like Jesus being a human also really teaches us to love each other and to trust each other because, you know, it's easy to believe like this interesting like mythical creature is like a god, but a human, not so much.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Okay, yeah. So again, the signs seeing the signs is evidence, but but in their absence, is that? Yeah.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 11:</span> Yeah, it's just hard for us to trust. Like even here it says because you though only a human are making yourself a god. Like they just keep reducing him to just being a human.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Mhm. Okay. Yep. Yeah, Sean.</p>

            <h3 id="outline-6">Discussion: Jesus as Human/Demon/God & Relatability</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 7:</span> With that too and um 10:21 it says, can a demon open the eyes of the blind? So it's like Jesus is compared and it's either he's a human or he's a demon. Like there's no like I mean if you I mean some people did believe that he was from God but like I just think it was interesting that he could either be a demon or he could just be a human telling lies and that's how the non-believers comparing him to. But I think saying that like can a demon open the eyes of the blind? Like that's like the idea of that is interesting because like a demon like would deceive and a demon would be able to in like theory like in that context like do that and then say like it was from God and then do the deceiving thing.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Yeah, good. Yeah, Tushar.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 10:</span> So like add on to the human aspect of Jesus like John 11 line 34. He said, where have you laid him? They said to him, Lord, come and see. Jesus began to weep. It just I I don't know, I like the aspect of part of Jesus being human. It makes us feel one of him rather than one of his disciples. Like we are part of him, we're all human. And then the fact that he weep like the humanity in him is like beautiful because we all weep. We all have those things. And then I also like wrote down like how it makes him feel more relatable and trustworthy because he has emotions. It's not like he's a God just ruling based on what he thinks is right, but he feels things, he feels things for himself, for others, for his mom. So it's like he has emotions so we can like trust that.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Mhm. Yeah, good. Reagan?</p>

            <h3 id="outline-7">Discussion: Contradictions & Nature of Belief</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 8:</span> Yeah, I agree with that. I think I was a little bit confused throughout the whole passage that we read about like what he claimed his role was because he did talk about being human and how him being human was him setting an example for his disciples to continue to love each other the way he had loved them as a human. And then he also talked about how he was like the judger and like through the father, he was here to like like judge humanity. I think he talked about that in 12 or 13. And then in 12, um verse like 47, he he says like, for I came not to judge the world, but to save the world. And so I feel like there's not I don't know if it's like contradictory, but there's just a lot of different ways that he's like talking about his role and like what he came here to do and I just think I got kind of lost through that.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> So again, it seems like there's there's just like these little pieces of contradiction in in John that that can really kind of throw us off like I think I have it and then this verse seems to like undermine that or something. Yeah, Sean.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 7:</span> With these questions too, like I was also surprised by like in the reading that it doesn't talk about how you do the believing either. It doesn't like there's not like really like don't it doesn't say like don't sin or don't do this, don't do that. It's just having the belief in itself. And I thought just saying that was just a little odd, I think. Especially when like like taking out the mystery of John too and how it's such a complex like text and like how it was written like in very good Greek, like it wasn't formally saying anything else like that. It was just talking about you have to believe and that's just how you do it.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Yeah, yeah, I know, hear that for sure. Yeah, Rick.</p>

            <h3 id="outline-8">Discussion: Comparison to Bhagavad Gita & Need for Structure</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 15:</span> Going back to the idea of seeing is believing, I feel like in the Bhagavad Gita, Krishna kind of does the same thing where like it's a spoken word that he is saying and then it's passed down from generation to generation as tradition, but then if it gets messed up at all, he comes back and he kind of like resets it. So like it still is like from that original source, it has to be from him. So like again, it's almost like a seeing is believing, it's just like a hearing is believing, but still.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> But then it kind of gets lost through this telephone game, right? Over time, the message keeps getting passed down and and lost. Yeah, I think that, yep. Tushar.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 10:</span> So go back to your point of like why all of this then if the goal is just to be like good humans to others, is that people need structure, people need something else to like adhere like believe in. And I could be completely wrong, it's personal, but I feel like this great religion has like so many aspects of like schools, politics, and just like the way things are run in a sense where it guides humans in their actions. So like I feel like just saying just be nice to others isn't good enough. You need like a structure, a system, things to do in order to feel like there's an end and that end is like eternal life or whatever you believe in so.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Okay, yeah. I hear. Yep. Jackie.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 13:</span> I totally get Tushar's point and I think it's really interesting and I do think that as a human you want something to believe in, like something that makes your mind at ease, something that makes you more comfortable. And I think because John at this whole community where he was baptizing people that were fully removed away from Jesus, like didn't see these acts in person. And as Rick was saying that you just hear you just hear the word and you go with it. And I do think that clearly it's effective. I mean, that's what we do now. We didn't see any of these. We just hear the word and we go with it. But I think the people also have to want it. Like a person wants has to be able to not just be open-minded to being like, oh well, obviously he made the blind man see again. Like but you also have to want that like body guiding you.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Mhm. Mhm. Yeah, and there's a certain tranquility or comfort in sort of being told, do this, don't do that, right? If I ask you, do you want green or yellow? then it's like a little bit of anxiety, like I have to make a choice. But if it's like, here's green, it's like, okay, you know, like no. If there's a path, people If there's a path, just follow it here, just do this. Yeah. Yeah, Matthew.</p>

            <h3 id="outline-9">Discussion: Blind Faith vs. Questioning Faith</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 16:</span> Yeah, kind of going back to that idea about the blind faith. Like I think some of this like might be confusing and if you just like don't question it at all, you could almost classify that as like blind faith because I think when you're asking these questions about, oh, what does this mean? And then you like search for the answer within yourself, that kind of almost could build your faith in a way versus if you just be like, oh everything I read, I'm going to like think it's 100% true and not ask any questions about it. I think that could lead you to faithful or blind blind faith.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> So, maybe we could say theology is like faith that's always seeking understanding but never quite grasping the understanding, right? It's like climbing this It's the search that matters. It's the quest that that is faithful. Yeah. Buy that? I feel like I've heard that somewhere before. Yeah, Jack.</p>

            <h3 id="outline-10">Discussion: Greek Orthodox Connection & Community</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 11:</span> With this understanding thing, it makes me think of my own religion. I'm Greek Orthodox and when I go to church services like for Easter or whatever, the entire service is in Greek. And I don't speak Greek. But you know, just being there and you really do feel that sense of community and that love and I don't understand the words that are being said, but there's something to that too. There's definitely like a feeling of connectedness and know you don't have to understand like every word, but there's definitely power in that love and that community.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Great. Good. There is, by the way, like a direct historical and deep, deep theological connection between Greek Orthodox Church and this particular gospel. Even more than some of the other ones. So, yeah, which is something we could explore in different context.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 11:</span> For Greek Orthodox, there's it's definitely like darker than I'd say like Catholicism in that there's a lot of focus on like sinning and repenting. There seems to be some of that going on in here too like that you have to follow and sinning and Mhm. I see that kind of parallel.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Yeah. Good. Others? We're running out of time.</p>

            <h3 id="outline-11">Highlight: The Beloved Disciple (John 13:23)</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> I want to draw attention to one thing that would be very, very, very easy to miss and overlook, especially if this is your first time reading the gospel. So chapter 13 verse 23. So, we have here, this is from the right, this is from the the Passover, like the this is kind of the last supper, right? But the Passover meal. And one of his disciples, the one whom Jesus loved. So, I brought this up when I was introducing the text, right? A couple weeks ago about the beloved disciple, the disciple whom Jesus loved, who's never identified or named, but this is the first reference that we've encountered in the text to the the disciple whom Jesus loved. We'll encounter this disciple a couple of more times as the text goes on. But I just wanted to draw attention to it more more for future for future classes when we're when we'll encounter it again. Only a few minutes left, but I want to make sure anybody else has a chance to chime in if they haven't. Don't necessarily have to have anything super profound to say. Yeah, Colin.</p>

            <h3 id="outline-12">Discussion: Intentions vs. Actions & Peter's Denial</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 17:</span> I think the point in the chapter 10 verse 13, the hired hand runs away because the hired hand is not prepared for the sheep is really important with what Tushar was saying earlier about how like you have all these other values imposed within religion like monetary value and power and fame. And I think that it's putting the point out that you need to keep it like simple, like you need to do it for the want to do it, not because you're expecting anything out of it.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> So, which could raise the question of so since there's all this emphasis on belief more than action and and in a little bit there on love too, that maybe that's the point that really it's about sort of forming your intentions and forming your desires. It's not telling you do this, don't do that, but instead, if you become the kind of person that believes this way, then you'll become the kind of person that loves and the kind of person that makes decisions in those sort of ways. Word? Yeah, I think something else that kind of relates to that is the last line of 13 when it says, will you lay down your life for me? Very truly I tell you before the cock crows, you will have denied me three times. So I feel like that relates to like belief and like how much does our faith mean if like we don't actually back it up by actions.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Mhm. Yeah. Word.</p>

            <h3 id="outline-13">Podcast Assignment Instructions</h3>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> Oh, so I should say thing about the your next podcast. So your next podcast is due, you know, preferably before the next class. And you've been doing great work. So unless I have specifically, you know, spoken to your team, then just keep going with what you've been doing. Nice work. But hold on, stay with me. Just to be super clear, so we've got group leaders A, B, C and D, right? So this is a this is a important rule. I want to make sure that if you were a group A leader that was the first two chapters of the Bhagavad Gita, right? So if you're a group A leader, then for your podcast, I want you to do something from the Gospel of John, right? Do one of the passages from the Gospel of John. Don't try to cover the entire thing, right? Don't try to cover the entire passages from any of these texts. There's way too much to to do that. I don't and it would be super watered down. I'd rather you pick a small passage, a small group of verses or even a single verse or something from the Gita or a couple passage from the Gospel of John. And you know, I'd love for you to make connections to the other past other parts of the gospel and that sort of thing. But kind of keep one little passage at the center, right? And kind of say, I really want to focus on this. Tell me why you're focusing on that. And you know, so is that clear? So if you did, if you were a group leader today, then you should in your podcast do something from the Bhagavad Gita. And if you were a group leader on Tuesday, you should do something from the Gospel of John. So switching back and forth. Yeah, Jackie.</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Student 13:</span> Can you compare the two? Like if you're supposed to prepare the Gita, can you compare it to John?</p>
            <p><span class="speaker">Brad:</span> I think I think as long as you're as long as you're giving the text reading the text on their own, I think sometimes those comparisons become unavoidable and if it feels like I I can't not say it, then say it.</p>
